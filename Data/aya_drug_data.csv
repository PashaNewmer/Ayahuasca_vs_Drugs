1,"After you took Aya, did you want to quit? Did you take your job more seriously? Were you better at it? More alert?   


I am wondering because a guy i worked with just quit, upping my workload a bunch. I love the company i work for and the freedom they give me and they are letting me take 2 weeks to do this trip (they don't know it is Aya though i told them it is meditation in the Amazon) I wouldn't want to have some experience where afterwards i can't work or no longer want to. Even though that may be what i need ( i don't really see how, i enjoy my work ) but if some crazy revelation comes out that i need to be a surf instructor or a yoga teacher ( i could see this happening) I would feel horrible for the company that has treated me so well thus far. 

Any thoughts/insight/experience on this?

(Sorry i post here a lot, I am very nervous and curious about this experience)

6,"Hi! This is kind of a cautionary tale about trying Ayahuasca for healing. It is my experience and I hope people can learn from it and take the risks into consideration around this powerful modality. I think Ayahuasca can help a lot of people and there are more than enough positive accounts around that. My experience is very different and I got in touch with some people for whom this experience was quiet damaging as well. For more severe childhood based trauma I think this modality is risky and there needs to be a lot in place when things go in a more fragmenting than healing direction. So here goes my story:

I've been dealing with depression, trauma, maybe c-ptsd, mild dissociation etc. since I am about 16 years old. I am 29 now and started therapy around 10 years ago. I did a lot of therapy in my life which was mostly talk therapy (depths psychology, cbt etc.), mindfullness meditation, yoga and did the medication route as well. Nothing had sustainable success and I really tried a lot. Then I heard about Ayahuasca and got quiet deeply into the topic with lots of reading, going to conferences and presentations around the topic of psychedelics for healing etc.. Although I was actively searching I couldn't find a therapist or responsible group in the realm of psycholytic therapy and therefore turned back to Ayahuasca since I knew there are good and responsible centers. I was desperate for help because I was really suffering and was stuck in my life as well since I couldn't attend university anymore and felt quiet dysfunctional in many aspects of my life. I decided to now go for it and fill the gap between ""knowing"" a lot around the topic but having zero experience with any psychedelic. I tapered slowly down my medication (an SNRI) and prepared very well (maybe even too rigorous with very strict diet for 3 months, meditation etc.) for an Ayahuasca Retreat at a well established Center which lives up to its reputation to be a very safe and responsible place. I worked for over 3 months in a car factory to afford this trip and had a lot of hope in this modality. ""I was at the end of my rope"" as many Ayahuasca retreat participant state it in hundreds of Ayahuasca Testimonials. But all of these testimonials then state ""... and then Ayahuasca saved me"" and none of them said ""and then Ayahuasca didn't save me, I slipped and lost that rope"". That's what happened to me and is rarely shared.

Safety is probably one of the most important topics when trying to work through trauma. And I mean it on a gut level. For example when I was in Peru I tried to convince myself that I am safe there and that they have lots of experience with it etc. but on a gut level I didn't feel save enough sitting in the dark kind of alone in ceremony with 2 very foreign people in charge (it was a woman and her son leading the ceremonies and they were two very kind people and everything but I think I needed something else). There were also two facilitators who we could always call to get help from but I didn't feel entitled to call them when I was kind of feeling nothing since I was in a dissociated space already which I just didn't recognize at the time (through Meckel Fischer I think I understood this dissociation part in psychedelic sessions when she talks about it in this video at around 23.30min https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1nOUFNjJdM ). That's how I maybe unconsciously even repeated the trauma of omission there in ceremony.

For me something just happened the day after the first ceremony with a very low dose of ayahuasca that I got into a serious mental health crisis. I am lucky I am alive and i am thankful to the staff which is partly trained in trauma focused therapies like SE or TRE. I got in a state I never experienced before in the afternoon after the first night of ceremony. I felt as if i couldn't hold the terror and overwhelm in my body and brain anymore and had the feeling I had to kill myself to end this terror within myself. One of the facilitators worked very hard to keep me oriented and keeping me from going into a full dissociated state. This had nothing to do with ego death or things like that and I am happy they could discern between those states. If I was in a hippie ""just let go and breathe into it"" environment I would have maybe never made it out of the jungle. I was really really lucky they had skills around these situations.

To make things short: I still stayed the full 3 weeks, had 4 more ceremonies which really didn't help at all and at the end the facilitators suggested when I was in a quiet dangerous mental situation back in Iquitos to go and get help from a psychiatrist they work with in those extreme cases to at least get me benzos for me to make my flight back home because in the states I was in I simply couldn't enter a plane and make a flight back home to Germany. Back home I just wasn't getting out of these extreme states of dissociation, suicidality and high activation/panic that I decided I can't take care of myself anymore and don't also want burden friends to take care of me 24/7 because this would have been needed at that point. After 6 weeks in a clinic in Bremen (where I come from) I went back to Leipzig to try to build some ""normal"" life structure with maybe a job to give me some structure, doing grounding things like gardening, sports etc. but after only 3 days I ended up in the closed psychiatric ward because I simply couldn't manage simple daily tasks and was still basically trying to survive every day and resist the impulses to end this terror by taking my own life. At no point I had psychotic or manic symptoms and my rational brain was fully functional but after such a long time in pure desperation and no signs of improvements I was also physically beginning to get tired and lost hope. Since there is quiet a strong will inside of me to live at some point and not simply survive I decided to protect myself from me giving in to the hopelessness and suicidality. That's when I ended up voluntarily in a closed psychiatric ward (which is an experience on its own).
It is quiet ironic that I wanted to get out of the psychiatric system (although I am also thankful for the help I got there) and ended up deeper in it than ever before. At the same time I kind of have to laugh about myself that I worked about 3-4 months my ass off in a car factory to spend and equal amount of time in psychiatry in pure terror..... I think it wasn't really worth it ;-).

I still think Ayahuasca can be very beneficial and I saw it first hand with the other participants but for me it was simply too much too quickly I think. It retraumatized me and I probably got in touch with too much suppressed material which I couldn't hold even in a well supportive environment or I heavily bounced of my defenses with intense fear/rage, dissociation etc. The combination of this extreme crisis plus the lost hope in this modality were simply a disaster. I felt too broken that anything in this world would be possible to help me. I think I was also too dependend on it to work. I was conscious about this and the risks around Ayahuasca and that it would not just make click and I would be healed but I thought with good preparation, a lot of my own experience with therapy, meditation etc and a responsible setting the risks are low for what then in the end happened to me and I think it is actually quiet rare but it happens and not only to me.

Then I didn't really have a well prepared plan for the time back home especially when things would go as they did. Another topic is the big cultural difference and the confusion around what really happened. I am familiar with the cosmology of the Shipibo curanderos since I went into understanding them but knowing is not having them internalized and then being really able to go with their perspective. The facilitators are in a difficult situation as well since they want to treat the Shipibo perspective with respect and be a cultural translator but then on the other hand they have western trauma training. In a situation of crisis it was for me definetely better to be working in a western model since I unfortunately just didn't feel any connection to the shamanistic cosmology although I really would have loved to get a sense of that. There are many more aspects here and now I just spontaniously wrote down quickly my story.",Ayahuasca,How I lost my rope and ended up hospitalized after an Ayahuasca Retreat
7,"Dear Community

I am going to travel to Pucallpa for a one-month retreat at a well-respected healing center. My goal is to pack lightly and only bring a carry-on with me.

Travel period is going to be between August and September.

# Fabrics to wear

* I am specifically worried about mosquitos and the correct fabrics to war. My initial thought based on my travel experience in Asia was to wear long sleeved shirts as well as long pants, maybe linen.   

* The fabric should be very easy to wash with mild soap which should not spoil the riverside. Additionally I would love to rely on fabrics which are simple and should not require washing every day.   

* Merino seams a little over the top and too delicate to handle mosquito attacks but has other desired attributes such as rapid drying and good odor resistance 

# What to pack

* What are your experiences with longer stays in the Amazonian jungle? Did you bring a photo-cam with you, or a cellphone at all? I am not going to have reception and power anyways and would love to keep my experience to myself picture wise, at least for my fist stay out of respect to the retreat and the maestro in charge.   

* Medical first aid kit: Besides some Isopropyl-Alcohol for disinfection as well as patches, a scissor and some compression material and bepanthen plus creme, I would think that NSAIDs, Benzos, Melatonin, stomach protection pills etc. pp are obsolete. Maybe a malaria treatment if available?   

* Besides some notebooks and maybe one or two books which might guide me further, I would love to avoid external stimuli such as literature, music and other electronic devices. Would you consider this a wise idea given the long stay there? Usually I am a person whose thoughts are almost always running so external distraction can be quite welcome in      weak moments, but I consider myself a very trained person in being on my own and ""withstand"" the pressure of being until the point of      where I can focus enough to reach a sort of calmness on the inside.

#Motivation

* I am trying to lay down the expectations, but it would be a contradictory claim to say that ""I am just going to the retreat for shits and giggles""   

* I love exploring my mind and have done so since I can think back   

* My life is filled with different traumata, deeply rooted from childhood experiences (catalyzed from external - as well as      internal factors), health issues (cancer in my youth) and a great deal of experience with psychological and, less so, physical violence. I am a functioning C-PTSD type of person and am holding a very stressful job plus      am currently studying   

* I am willing to spare the month to reduce the external stressors and pick up my inner workings in an environment which provides calmness, understanding and a minimum of material factors in order to  deepen my relationship with myself and to shift gears towards self-healing        

* For me this is a very big step as I have always wanted to finish this and that in order to be complete, only to be thrown into another (often self-initiated) chain of problem solving circles

   
 I would love to hear about your opinion, experiences with retreats of similar length or just your thoughts about the points stated above.

9,"I updated my previous thread with what's below, but felt I needed to create a new thread so it doesn't get buried in here. 

So I had my first Aya experience over the weekend and it was awful. I felt something starting to happen after 15-20 minutes - a warmth coming over my body. Then I started to get very hot, sweaty and threw up (a lot) after 25 minutes. I was supposed to hold in the first dose for at least 1 hour, but my body rejected it. Then I felt cold and covered myself up. Other than feeling a bit drained and cold from throwing up, I felt nothing. I went to the restroom and experienced massive diarrhea. Hour and a half later, I accepted a 2nd dose and threw up (a lot again) less than 1 minute after ingesting it. Again, I felt more drained and cold. 5 minutes later I was offered a 3rd dose since my body immediately rejected the 2nd dose, and told I should just take 1/2 of it which I did. I managed to hold it in about 1/2 hour before purging just clear liquid and stomach bile. I went to the restroom again and had my 2nd bout of massive diarrhea. I should point out that I also threw up even more stomach bile at the same time as I was having explosive diarrhea (a first for me). Afterwards, I felt extremely weak, shivering from cold, and sweating. I could barely walk back to my sleeping bag. I asked for 2 extra blankets. I didn't take the remainder of the 3rd dose. There was nothing left in me, but I still threw up again (more stomach bile). I felt even weaker and more sick afterwards - similar to having a very bad flu + the feeling of having been beaten up by a gang of people. I was given a few heating pads as well. I was very weak and dehydrated, so I drank just 1/2 cup of water. I threw up again 5-10 minutes after drinking that water and now I was even more weak and dehydrated than before. I was afraid my body was dangerously low in water, sugar, and electrolytes, so I chewed on an apple just ingesting the juice and spitting out the skin and rest of it. 10 minutes later I threw up again all that small amount of juice along with more stomach bile. The ceremony had started at 9:30pm and now it was 2:30am. I started to feel less sickly and eventually fell asleep hard till 7:30am when I was woken up by bright fluorescent lights being turned on and woken up from a dream. I was irritated that I was woken up. All 4 other participants in our group had tripped pretty hard. They went on and on about their experience and visions. I, on the other hand, experienced no visions whatsoever, other than feeling extremely sick to my stomach for 4-5 hours and throwing up 6-7 times in the process along with masssive diarrhea twice. I was just irritated listening to the others go on and on. I just wanted to pack up and go home which I did. It was one of the worst experiences I've ever had and will never do it again. It's unfortunate as my friends whom never tried it were excited to hear back from me and I doubt they'll do it after hearing about my account. The ceremony went from Saturday night until Sunday morning. I was drained but overall doing ok much of Sunday, but I was very depressed, angry, and irritable yesterday (Monday). Today (Tuesday) I feel almost normal again. I wouldn't feel as let down if I just purged twice and didn't experience the visions and whatnot, but I feel really let down because of top of that, I purged A LOT more than everyone else in the group and I felt deathly sick almost the entire time. Overall, a waste of $150.

He traveled very far to be with her and even threatened that they would no longer speak if she backed out due to health problems. He has been very manipulative and self righteous through the process and I have chose to stand down as she is an adult and I know I am very much capable of similar controlling behavior (though I would deny to this degree)when consumed with fear— I have chosen to remain open desipte several red flags. She is going through a very serious depression, return of OCD, and PTSD that has been exasperated by overworking. He is refusing to let her seek treatment advising that such medical care is dangerous. He has done similar things to other family members such as getting involved between a cousin and their therapist— behavior that I find very disturbing. He has even told her that she should quit her job and sell her possessions though she supports their parents and would lose healthcare. Anyway, any recommendations on how to support my GF after a potentially difficult experience?

19,"I had my first Aya experience this weekend. Two ceremonies, led by highly experienced indigenous shamans. My second ceremony was incredibly difficult. I went to a kind of hell and experienced what I can only describe as a demonic possession. It was also incredibly therapeutic. I came out of it loving the crap out of myself. I don't know how it works, but the traumatizing event brought me to deep and clear healing realizations. 

The remedy was wearing off when a shaman came to my mat around 4 in the morning, woke me up, and asked if I was leaving the next day, which was one day early. (I had wanted to only do 2 nights instead of 3, and interestingly enough, on the 2nd night, the first message Aya told me, clear as day and in no uncertain terms, was to not come back. Ever. I'm not certain if the shaman got this message via the plant, or whether there was some kind of note next to my name on paperwork somewhere which noted that I may leave early, something I had told the facilitator a few weeks prior, and he just realized it then, at 4 am, when that night's ceremony was almost over). 
I told him I was leaving early. He asked if I wanted a cleansing ceremony. They were only doing them for first-timers, and had already one one with a group of newbies earlier in the night. Sure, I said, and I followed him. I was then set on a chair near a fireplace and surrounded by shamans for a private cleansing. I felt incredibly special, since the cleansing that had occurred the first night and earlier that one that night were done in groups.

My hair and body were doused with a kind of a plant tea. Marakas and chanting created a cacophony of noise that was as incredible as it was overwhelming. They blew large palm fronds around me, creating a kind of swirling wind. Incense in a frying pan filled the air with smoke. 

Earlier that day the Shamans explained that the cleansing ritual was the most important part of the whole experience. That body language was everything. That we should embody physically how we want to walk through the world, and to imagine ourselves as we want to be in the future. I remembered this, and sat up straight. I thought of giving a presentation in front of all the executives at my company, and casually laughing in front of the audience. I thought of this probably because at the last one I gave, I had the first and only panic attack of my life and came incredibly close to fainting- wobbling in front of the room.

The chanting increased in intensity and it felt like energies were being circulated in the air. I wanted to soak the experience up and be as much in the present moment as I could. But I began to feel sick. After a few minutes I got very cold, and was so weak I could no longer sit up straight. I put my head in my hands. The shaman had me sit up straight again, and put my hands back in my lap, palms facing up. I wanted to be strong. 

I wasn't nauseous anymore but all the energy was drained from my body, and blood was drained from my head. It felt like fainting. A few more times I bent over and was raised back up by the shaman. But it just got worse. I said I needed to lay down.

Two female shamans stood on either side of me, walking me toward my mat. Half way there, I started collapsing. They told me to stay strong, to keep going. I stood upright again and tried to continue. I couldn't. I fell to the ground and lost consciousness. When I started to come back, I could hear the shamans saying to me ""No no no no stay here"" (or something to that effect, it was all in Spanish). My legs were splayed out in front of me on the ground, and they were holding my torso up by my shoulders. One of them held my face in her hand, squeezing my cheeks so hard it hurt. And there was another pair of arms outstretched, with hands on my chest, pumping over my heart, like CPR. I was jolted back awake.

I was helped back to my mat and once laid down, I felt immediately better.

The next morning I heard from the shamans that fainting in the cleansing ceremonies was not an uncommon occurrence. One of the shamans said to me ""You had your first battle!"" 

But it doesn't make sense to me. The hell that I experienced during my trip, strange as it seems, ended up making sense by the time it was all over. That was a battle I fought, and I was proud of myself for it.

But the fainting didn't feel that way. It just felt like energy was drained from me. It felt like a demonstration of weakness. (Now, it could also have been because it was 4 in the morning, I had barely slept for the past 48 hours, had just experienced a very physically and mentally intense journey, and hadn't eaten in 16 hours...)

I'm interested to hear if others have experience fainting on Aya and if so, what explanation or significance it had for you.

I was dealing with an irritated bladder (I'd just had a cystoscopy to investigate potentially causes of my overactive bladder, which seemed to cause the irritation), and after taking ayahuasca, the bladder got worse — felt like it was burning for about a week. Didn't think it was related, but two weeks later, I did it again and that burning feeling came back for a few days. Eventually I went to a doctor who said I had an ""irritable bladder"" and acidic foods/drinks were irritants. I read that ayahuasca is acidic. Initially I believed that the ayahuasca was trying to tell me something via its effect on my bladder - that perhaps it wanted me to pay more attention to this health issue, or look at the emotional roots of it. But now I'm thinking, what if it's simply a bladder irritant?

If the occasion does arise I would love to do Ayahuasca, but I don't see a shaman coming around to my part of the world any time soon. ",Ayahuasca,Hello I question about diet
30,"*Foreword: This is not my own writing- I found this on a forum and thought it already appropriate to post to begin the discussion I'm trying to get at.* 

&amp;#x200B;

PSSD is a condition caused by persistent de-sentisization of serotonin receptors and dopamine down-regulation 

SSRI's also downregulate 5-ht2a and 5-ht2c, as well as type 1 desensitization. The big issue is now all of the other type 1 subtypes, and their corresponding inhibition of dopamine,NMDA, glutamate, acetylcholine etc....also oxytocin decreases are a big one. 5-HT1A downregulation is NOT going to cause libido issues directly, but indirectly because the PreSynaptic heteroreceptors inhibit serotonin release and function. [**(!)**](http://psychopharmacologyinstitute.com/cns-receptors/5-ht1a-receptors/)  **However, POSTSYNAPTIC 5-HT1A activation may cause sexual dysfunction.** [**(!)**](http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?articleID=96978) [**(!)**](http://www.paxilprogress.org/forums/showthread.php?t=55667)

Thus more serotonin is now floating around at 1B,1D,1F,2A,2C,3,4,5 as a result of presynaptic 5-HT1A downregulation, yet the postsynaptic 5-HT1A's induce prolactin, endorphin, cortisol, ACTH and oxytocin release. [**(!)**](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9678651) [**(!)**](http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/scicurious-brain/2013/08/05/knocking-5-ht1a-down-to-bring-mood-up/) [**(!)**](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2952898) [**(!)**](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2956114) [**(!)**](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15013031)

""Everyone knows the main theory about the pathogenesis of PSSD: the excessive release of serotonin (which has a mixed but essentially inhibitory role on sexual functions) by the serotonergic neurons (concentrated in the raphe nuclei of the midbrain) caused the ""desensitization"" of 5-HT1A autoreceptors (that act as sentinels that regulate the release of a substance according on how much there is already in circulation, this mechanism is also called negative feedback).

The ""down regulation"" of the 5-HT1A autoreceptors is instead caused by chronic and excessive activation by its natural ""agonist"" (serotonin) that is made available in abnormal quantities by the use of SSRIs. It is therefore natural to think to the autoreceptors as something that is ""damaged"" by excessive competition and that can be cured using an antagonist that lead him to be again ""sensitive.""

At this point that we have to do a reflection: the autoreceptor is a sentinel, a switch that if ""on"" sends a chemical signal. What the cell (neuron) have to do when it receives this chemical signal is written in the genes, that is in the sequence of the DNA; how much it should do (that is, how much to increase or decrease the release of serotonin) it depends on the genes expression.""

&amp;#x200B;

I have anecdotally experienced anhedonia &amp; noticeable lack of sexual interest from taking Sertraline &amp; Escitalopram and have subsequently found a huge variance in my research to try and find decent treatment. The pharmacological approaches I have seen in no particular order range from:

. PDE5 Inhibitors (which will help erection but not arousal)

. Dopamine releasers/ Stimulants: Amphetamine also seems to help sufferers but only to a degree during the course of action (unsustainable)

. SJW: Theorised to upregulate 5ht2c and other 5ht receptors 

. Cyproheptadine/ Mirtazapine: Antagonises 5ht broadly, could be of great use but sedation and other sides (weight gain, congitive decline) could pose as a problem 

&amp;#x200B;

What do you guys think of in terms of approaches to recovering natural function after chronic use of SSRIs? I believe that a novel agent or approach would be of great benefit to many, many people. A cursory look through the internet will reflect a very large minority of SSRI users that have suffered long term issues related to desensitisation and with continuing and increasing use of SSRIs in clinical practice the disorder will only become more prevalent until safer agents are found.

I mention this one because it was made as a safer alternative to MDMA, according to wikipedia. Many years ago I found an RC website selling it. It wasn't some site that had listings for every RC imaginable or something, it was a basic NBOMe seller that got other stuff on occasion. He could have sold bk-MDMA even easier than this but instead listed this as the product he had. I mention this because many people find it hard to believe any RC vendor would have this type of chemical. So I tried it and it was pretty awesome. Basically MDMA-lite and the non-existent comedown/suicide Tuesday confirmed this.

I'm not advocating for this chem specifically (although its reason for being synth'd is quite relevant) but more just wondering why ""safer"" empathogens like this aren't being studied for treatments like MDMA.

55,"Hello,

I'm really hoping that this community can help or offer some advice. I've included the back story as I feel it's important but maybe a bit long so apologies for that! 

My boyfriend and I have been together 3.5years. We are both close to 40 years old.

 When we first met he had recently experienced a life changing ayahuasca retreat. I also wanted to try it and i did so once and was a bit ambivalent about the whole experience. Later that year he went to Peru for a month and again had a life changing experience. It was all he could talk about. 

At this point we'd been together just over a year. As it was something so important to him and something he said would help me I wanted to try again.  I went with him for another ceremony. It was without a doubt one of the worst experiences of my life. An inexperienced 'shaman' only in it for the money. I suffered horrific flashbacks and anxiety for a long time afterwards and swore off ayahuasca forever (I have experience with LSD and Mushrooms and even my few bad trips on them were not even close to that night of hell)

He then decided that he wanted to go to peru for a long time...between 3 and 6 months.  We realised that our relationship wouldn't survive him going away for 3-6 months with little contact and he decided that he would stick to going to Peru for a month a year. It's still not easy but we make it work.

However now he is at a stage where he again wants to go deeper and work more with the plants. He wants to do a series of 3 month diets at home (6 times in total). Physical intimacy is a huge thing for me and to be brutally honest I'm not sure how I can support him doing this as we do live together. I really want to support him in his quest but I feel he is asking so much of me. I already get frustrated when he comes back from Peru every year and we still can't have sex for a few weeks after his return. It turns me into a complete bitch which I hate. We have recently discussed getting married before he told me he wants to do these long diets. I'm really stuck. On one hand I want to support him in any way that I can but on the other (very selfish) hand I don't want to be with someone that is imposing their dieta on me. Obviously it's not just sex that will be off the cards for the 3 months as he will be on a strict food dieta as well so this impacts us in our social life too. 

He has said that he won't break up with me so I feel that the pressure is on me to either support him, which I do want to do but I want to be able to do it gracefully and without resentment  or walk away from the love of my life and the man I want to marry.

I've been looking all over the Internet for advice but I can't find any advice for where one person is doing long dieta and has a partner that hates ayahuasca.

If anyone has any advice no matter how small I would be very grateful to hear it!

Thank you

TL;DR boyfriend wants to do lots of long dieta, I don't know if I can put my physical needs to the side to support him in this 

UPDATE
Thank you all for your replies. I meditated a lot on what was behind my resistance to support him and I found the answer. I won't go into it here as it's deeply personal but I shared this knowledge with my partner and he fully understands. Now with the knowledge of what is causing the resistance we have been able to discuss the situation more and come up with plans to make it work. 

It definitely won't be easy. We both know that but we are working on strategies that will help us both cope with the dieta when he is ready to do it. We both strongly believe in supporting each other on our individual spiritual paths and are truly committed to making it work. ",Ayahuasca,Help with boyfriend doing long dieta

I had two ceremonies in Sacred Valley,Peru 5 weeks ago.

The first ceremony was beautiful. I felt love for myself and the beautiful body I am in. Gratitude, love, laughter, ahh it was amazing. I felt this for about 15 mins before The nurse came over and encouraged me to drink more water to purge everything out of my body. Once I had purged every bit of water and aya out, I felt this sensation of obedience take over and I was almost forced to sit back against the wall in a seating position. I stayed in this same position for hours. At first I received messages of why certain people in my life are suffering. I was able to disconnect myself from the reality we live in and make sense of human behavior and the world at this time. A lot of bad things have happened to the people I love. I connected dots right then and there, which never crossed my mind in real life. I went in with one of my intentions to learn what my purpose was here on this earth at this time. I was shown that my healing ability is to provide sacred space, and that I should have no fear in this. Once I had finished purging, I felt no more effects . I was pretty much sober during this with random thoughts, completely observing the room while everyone else is tripping. I noticed that when the shaman would sing icaros and do his cleansing work, I was doing it with him. I telepathically heard my brother speak to me. I was sucking  energy of those around me and blowing it out like the shaman. It was as if I was a shaman too. 

The second ceremony, they had increased my dosage. I took it and felt nothing. I was requested more and was agitated as I could see everyone else around me having their experience with aya. They eventually gave me a second dose and again I felt nothing. It was a huge disappointment. The crazy thing is when the director checked on me, I told him I didn’t feel anything and it is perhaps because I know everything I need to know at this time. A girl in the room was going through absolute hell for hours and while she was doing this, I randomly would purge for her many times. She told me after the ceremony she felt that I was with her the entire time and knew I purged  her demons. 

I was extremely emotional after this experience and overwhelmed with what I had received in the first ceremony about my loved ones. I didn’t get a chance to talk to the psychologist, but I wanted to know why I experienced being a shaman and why I didn’t receive anything the second ceremony.

84,"Hi everybody!

I am looking for advice in how to best help a couple persons which i believe would benefit immensely from Ayahuasca.

I am currently working for an Hotel, it's a family business run by 2 brothers in their 60ies, their wives and sons.
They all really like me very much.

The 2 persons i have in mind are one of the wives (the cook from now on) and one of the sons (the cameraman from now on): both of them have confided me in multiple occasions how they are having a hard time psychologically.

The cook has had a rough last year. She is deeply unhappy about her lifestyle, has some unresolved family issues, perceives becoming increasingly apathetic and is burned out from work on top of all that.

The cameraman has been struggling with apathy as well and in a greater degree. He described how he sees life as a series of meaningless tasks. He stated he has no emotions anymore (even though it is clear he is angry for no particular reason most of the time) and no interest in anything.

Now, knowing them quite well, knowing what their issues are and how they have tried to solve them i have no doubt in my mind they both would greatly benefit from ayahuasca.

The problem lies in that their family as a whole is very hotblooded, it is extremely difficult to have them consider any opinion differing from the one they hold and they are generally against drugs that aren't alcohol.

Problem number 2 is that as much as they like me, my position there is in no way secure by means of work contract (i am ""on call"") so it could be risky for me to breech a subject like that.

Another important thing: the cook will be traveling to Perù in a couple months (she wanted to visit perù for the past 10+ years).

Can some of you envision how could i possibly make them aware about what is ayahuasca and how it works and that they could greatly benefit from it without them shutting the option out because of their preconceptions and risking my job?

Edit: i remembered that we have a common acquaintance that as far as i know, has been organizing some ceremonies. I will first try and get in contact with him to see if he would like to bring up the subject with them, leaving me out of it. If this can't be done, i think i will just send a link to a documentary to the cameraman saying i found it interesting.",Ayahuasca,[Advice] How to best introduce someone to Ayahuasca.

90,"Hello everybody, I have a question concerning the words currently being used to refer the tea and plants used in its prepare, I think this is the right place to ask. 

A little background first: I'm a medicine undergraduate working on a research project in Brazil, one thing I noticed is the wide variety ot terms used to describe the same things, and sometimes the same term being used to different things, here are some details:  

Ayahuasca seems to be originally used in reference to Banisteriopsis caapi, or ""cipó Mariri"", how it's called popularly here in Brazil. Somehow the concoction of this plant ended up also being called Ayahuasca, I think it was first Ayahuasca tea, and then Ayahuasca for short. Well, it starts being an issue when the concoction using Psychotria viridis \(Chacrona here in Brazil\) is also referred to as Ayahuasca, and the analogs that seem to exist, which sometimes don't even use Banisteriopsis caapi, the original Ayahuasca, also are called simply ""Ayahuasca"", I can use the tea made with Syrian Rue as an example, but there's other plants being used to substitute both B. caapi and P. viridis, whose final product, the tea, keeps being referred to as Ayahuasca in most scenarios.

My concern here is that to study aspects regarding the benefits of Ayahuasca there should be some consistency on it's constituents, I have mixed feelings about reports when I don't know the exact ingredients used in the tea, as there could be wild variation of substances and concentrations. The way I see, someone who uses Ayahuasca can:

1 - Drink a tea made of B. caapi alone;

2 - Drink a tea made of B. caapi + P. viridis;

3 - Drink a tea made of any plant with MAOI properties, probably with DMT or some form of entheogen in it.

It would be very helpful if someone here could guide me throught the etimology of the terms used, or refer me to some bibliography regarding these issues, as I feel the need to clarify these distinctions for my papers.

I experienced almost no fear, but i did experience some disappointment feeling like the dose has been to small to silence my mind/ego, which was constantly judgeing the experience, looking for the solution for the bad emotions in my psyche. As i am a psychologist. 

So, i would really love to experience a full ayachuasca experience and thinking about participating in a two night retreat. But they explicitely mention people with panic disorders should not participate. I dont have a diagnosed panic disorder except for some Social anxiety which is some times there and some times dont. And it inhibits my life sometimes and sometimes not. 

&amp;#x200B;

Would it be wise for me to participate? What is the worst possible outcome? 

Because if fear comes up, that might be alright for me, because the emotion is already in me and i haave to experience it.

94,"So I have the chance next week to do ayahuasca with a Shipibo Shaman who is being flown in from Peru to do a ceremony near where I live. I was asked by someone else who knows that I am heavy into psychedelics if I wanted to join.

Now I see people who go to do ayahuasca in an attempt to ""heal"" themselves and figure out problems they may have etc. But I do not feel any need to heal myself personally. I am very happy with how my life is and everybody in it, I am actually quiet content.

The only thing about my offer is that the person who asked I am infatuated with. I don't like to say love, because love is a strong word but I do have love for her. The only reason I would want to do ayahuasca is because I feel like it will make our relationship (or break). As corny as it sounds, I feel like the plant will enable me/us to see if our love is real for each other.

I've heard people say DMT will come into your life when its called to you. Well it's an insane instance of synchronicity to have the love of my life offer to do ayahuasca with her. It's almost a feeling of I met her for more reasons than just a relationship. For anyone who has gone through it, what would you do in my situation?

With daily use of phenibut tolerance builds to effects of Gaba B. But does the positive effects of the drug on voltage-dependent calcium channels and its antagonism of taar1 stay with continued use or do they too accumulate tolerance by downregulating etc.

Also after using two weeks in a row at 2g a day, I felt the tolerance come and mild withdrawal effects began without reducing or increasing the dose from 2g a day. After that passed after about 3 days from first realising the tolerance was coming, some nausea, anxiety, insomnia, pain, very mild. Currently on stable dosage of 40mg paroxetine though and used propranolol and cannabis to mitigate some of the withdrawals. I have now leveled out without any of those withdrawal symptoms and continuing at 2g a day. So the withdrawal started after 2 weeks without changing dose, lasted 3/4 days, and then stopped all without changing the dosage.

I still feel like I am less agitated than without phenibut, so I wonder if the gabapentinoid and taar1 effects are the reason I still have some benefit of phenibut despite tolerance to its effects on Gaba B.

It could also just be placebo effect but basically how I can tell is, I meditate. Without phenibut I get fairly agitated and pain fairly quickly, but even now as I meditate with Gaba B tolerance I still find it less painful and agitating than without Phenibut. Still this effect on meditation could be placebo feeling making me less anxious and therefore less agitated.

Problem is I feel like I've lost some of the motivating effects of Phenibut due to tolerance.

I'm hoping to travel to Peru near the end of July or start of August and am interested in finding a great retreat package, although I'm aware that I'm running out of time to find space in a retreat. I'm travelling alone, so hoping I can slot in somewhere -- and there does seem to be some good options like Arkana.

I am also planning on taking the Salkantay hike expedition towards Machu Picchu, which would take 7 days (5 day Salkantay, 2 day Sun Gate / Machu Pichu).  It might be my only chance to visit Peru, so I would like to experience both the Hike and the chance to work with ayahuasca.  

What order is best for both hiking and working with ayahuasca? 

I have heard different recommendations.  Some people say take the medicine and then go hiking, because it will help you integrate and experience the beauty of the journey. Other people say to hike first, so that once you are working with ayahuasca it's your only focus, and the lessons you go home with lessons to integrate.  Some people say the ayahuasca will make you too weak for the hike. Other people say the hike will make you too weak for ayahuasca!  Some people say you need to go into the experience following the diet, others say it's okay so long as you maintain the diet after you leave (which wouldn't be possible if I did the Salkantay trek after a retreat).

For those with experience --

Is a one week retreat with 3 aya ceremonies, and one San Pedro, enough to ""get"" the message?

Would you recommend hiking before or after imbibing?

I am looking at both Sacred Valley retreats as well as Iquitos retreats.  It would be cheapest and easiest to stay in Sacred Valley / Cusco, but I'm travelling to Peru for a once in a lifetime experience.  Is ""easy"" shooting myself in the foot? Is it actually much better to go straight into the jungle in Iquitos, or would the Sacred Valley retreats be perfectly fine?

Thanks so much for helping me plan my trip.  The issue I'm having is that I'm getting the above suggestions from different aya retreats saying completely different things about how to approach the trip, so it's hard to tell if they're being self serving to try and get me to their retreat or if there's just a bunch of ways to do this thing...",Ayahuasca,Conflicting Recommendations for Machu Pichu Hike + Retreat

137,"I had never even heard the term ""naturopathy"" until I started reading r/medicine a month or so ago. The people on there use it with such hatred and disgust, it's palpable. It's basically their go-to scapegoat for placing the blame of anything they don't like on. Is a patient questioning your judgment? *It's the goddam naturopaths. At it again!* Patient asked for an ""organic"" treatment? *Grrrr, Naturopaths.* etc. Their hate for them is a bottomless pit, essentially. 

Several times, for expressing some of my more unorthodox ideas about medicine, which involve among other things, drug legalization, right to try, and greater research and consideration for certain currently off-label uses, such as antipsychotics for insomnia, the potential of cannabinoids to treat pain, and the need to relax some aspects of FDA clinical trials while adding certain other new restrictions, I have been very aggressively accused of being ""one of the naturopaths"" or ""someone who should go join the naturopaths"" etc. 

Take a look for yourself if you like: https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/9jhv0q/large_study_questioning_safe_injection_sites/

So today I finally really looked into what that term even means. You would probably infer it means something about using ""natural"" medicine right? There is nothing odd about that in and of itself, by some estimates, up to 50% or more of all pharmaceuticals are derived from natural biological sources. Clearly loads of ""natural"" remedies are as valid as synthetic ones and **no one identifying with mainstream medicine doubts this for a second.** Also, the idea that I'm a naturopath who is promoting the use of antipsychotics? Really now? 

Real quick, let's name some of these natural and semi-synthetic (that is, nearly natural) pharmaceuticals -- morphine, aspirin, insulin, hydrocortisone, ephedrine, penicillin, heparin, atropine, quinine. That would be just a few of the better known ones. 

So why the hubub? Well, it would seem, their definition of ""naturopathy"" is limited to specifically those ""natural"" treatments which are judged as pseudoscientific. Basically, it isn't naturopathy to them unless it's demonstrated to be unfounded. A strange way of framing your opponents eh? Only the treatments that *do not work* are considered ""naturopathy."" 

Now, clearly there is some antagonism going both ways here, and there are some ""naturopaths"" who make it their mission to intentionally attempt to discredit mainstream medicine, maybe because they are disillusioned with it themselves I would guess. So it seems this whole thing is just a ridiculous flame war. 

It's very strange, and almost **dogmatically unscientific** the way all reason and moderation goes out the door as soon as the slightest implication of ""naturopathy"" appears. I keep hearing ""there is no evidence for this or that."" Well, clearly there is technically ""evidence"" for about any idea you could pull out of your ass, the question is whether there is evidence you consider to be *good evidence*. And also I keep hearing ""That has no proven efficacy/safety."" Just saying these things does not make them so. And let's not forget there are loads of mainstream treatments, such as SSRIs, benzos, and stims that have fairly dubious proven long term efficacy and loads of very serious risks. Or the fact that the current methods of treating psychosis still often result in very nasty side effects and rapid loss of efficacy, even today with the improved 2nd gen antipsychotics. 

The naturopaths also believe in *gasp* getting all your nutrition and lots of exercise! Sunlight and drinking water too! Those bastards! We can't have people thinking these are ways to get healthier! Except.....

Wait, but it's my doctor, a normal physician, who chooses ""get more exercise and eat better"" over pharmaceuticals 95% of the time. Is he a secret naturopath?

But anyway, the important thing to realize is this right here: **It doesn't make a fucking difference whether a treatment is ""natural"" or not. It's totally fucking irrelevant.** Ok? And also, **That some organization, be it the FDA, the AMA, hell, the catholic church even, proclaims dogmatically that some treatment is ""effective"" or ""safe"" or whatever else... Well, most of the time that might be a good indication what is being said is likely true, but, it is certainly not any kind of ""objective"" or ""inarguable"" answer to those questions. Even if several of them do, that is still not an absolute answer** The FDA can, has and does make mistakes, quite frequently even. 

The sad truth is, a clinical trial or other formal experiment may be biased exactly the same as some random anecdotal report can be. It's still a better option for more in depth analysis, but the risk is still there, just attenuated a little. The point is with a formal experiment, it's easier to control for bias and identify it when it appears, not that they will never appear at all.  

What I'm saying is not anti-science, it's 100% pro-science, because this is the way science works, you must be skeptical of everything, including, and even *especially* that which you have reason to trust. What is truly unscientific is just lumping in a whole swath of treatments (most of which you actually do indeed endorse) in with undeniably bullshit treatments under the label of ""pseudoscience"" selectively whenever it is convenient for you to do so. 

With any instance in which you define your opponent specifically in terms of being wrong about everything,  you are clearly setting up a straw man. And even worse here, the wild accusation this attitude entails is bound to mean all kinds of (potentially good) ideas are going to be lumped under that label just for having some vague connotation of it. 

Oh yeah, and since I need a link to an article to post on this sub, here's one piece of evidence for why cannabinoids can indeed treat pain: https://sci-hub.tw/https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11481-015-9600-6

There is plenty of evidence for both sides in this instance. You can take your pick basically, are cannabinoids a wildly dangerous and untested treatment for pain? OR are they actually a very well studied, very low risk, and remarkably effective treatment for certain types of pain especially? You cannot decide based on the available ""scientific evidence"" alone because it's contradictory. So what did I do to resolve? I used my common sense and personal experience as the tie breaker. I guarantee you everyone else, on either side, is doing the same thing to resolve this discrepancy.

The top comment by \[deleted\] mentions the role of NMDA receptors in regulating tolerances to other drugs:  

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;From everything I have read NMDAR tolerance is the most permanent receptor tolerance there is. Since it is itself the receptor that controls tolerance reset, you have not just a tolerance, but a tolerance to the rate at which tolerance decreases. 

&amp;#x200B;

I would like to know if there is any evidence, scientific or anecdotal, to support this claim. It's scary to imagine building a permanent tolerance to the decrease of tolerances.

Another question: is there believed to be a rebound effect from NMDA antagonism? Similar to GABAergics, are you left with the opposite effects of dissociation following the drug experience? Could this fuck with your glutamate system, causing it to be overactive?

My question is, are there any indicators/titrants that would be suitable for this purpose? Something that would react with cocaine but not other common cuts. It would look something like this:

Dissolve a weighed amount of ‘cocaine’ powder (say 0.100 grams) in water (or possibly buffer solution to control pH idk), add an indicator and stir bar. Put a titrating solution of *known* concentration in a burette and slowly add. the point where the solution changes color indicates that all of the cocaine has reacted with the titrant. By measuring the volume of titrating soln used, the amount of actual cocaine initially present could be calculated? 

Any feedback or criticism on this idea would be appreciated as I don’t have a solid grasp on how titrations work besides basic acid/base stuff in undergrad genchem.

154,"Hi all,

 I've known this guy for two years, but we've become much closer this year, resulting in an LDR.

Mr. Guy went to his first ceremony in South America a little over a year ago motivated by his techie friends. Since then, he has become a Rappé user (5-6x/day) and done close to a dozen Shamanic ceremonies in Europe and South America. Just in the last month, he has gone to weekend-long ceremonies every weekend.

During the ceremony last weekend he got violently ill when the brew he was given mixed with a stomach bug ( but he refused to rest). He's currently in South America and will be going to another ceremony this weekend which involves shrooms and Ayahuasca, although his body is still recuperating from last weekend's illness.

I have never been curious about drug use of any kind, but I respect personal choices and always encourage him to share his experiences.

Since he told me about the ceremonies and Aya, Rappe etc, I've been reading and learning more about it in order to understand his interest. I'm not one to tell him not to do it, but I did suggest that maybe his body needs some rest (he declined).

I'm becoming concerned for his mental and physical health. He has been making post-ceremony decisions based on his visions i.e. such as breaking business deals because the spirit told him so, moving to South America, etc. Just this week he told me he hasn't been productive with his work, and that he feels like he can't focus or get anything done.

So Reddit, do I have a reason for concern? Are weekly ceremonies a thing? 

I appreciate your insights.

155,"Hi there, I have had the calling for some time now and it has increased in intensity to have healing with Ayahuasca.

&amp;#x200B;

There are SO many retreats out there that I'm looking to hear from anyone about their experiences from the below retreats.

&amp;#x200B;

I have narrowed the list down, and listed some perceived pros and cons about each.

&amp;#x200B;

1. The new Rising sun.  Pros - seems to be one of the most authentic places out there, no holds barred medicine, with little Western influence. Cons- couple of reports I read, people found it hard to deal with such an intense experience and a first hand report said that her integration afterwards was too intense although the experience was great.
2. Nimea Kaya - Pros - seems like the safest option for a gringo first timer. Well organised set up. Cons - large group - worried may not get personal attention required from the shamans - and also perhaps little time to speak with them about your experiences????
3. DreamGlade - Pros - can't find anyone saying a bad word about them, apparently they have a strong brew. Smaller groups and offer the use of some other medicines such as Kambo and Sananga. Cons, difficult to find any cons, just wondering about the quality of their shamans? I also for some reason didn't get as good a vibe from them during my research as the other centres mentioned
4. Kawsay - Pros - Can have a san pedro ceremony as well, looks like they have experienced shamans.

Others I looked at, Casa De La madre and Aya Madre - both look like nice places also.

&amp;#x200B;

Conclude, this maybe the only time i get to do this in Peru so I want to ensure that I get the full healing. A part of me says you will most likely get this with Orlando at the New Rising Sun but it might be intense. My feeling says Nimea Kaya, and the logical brain says DreamGlade.

&amp;#x200B;

So hard to decide.

&amp;#x200B;

Any help would be grateful.

&amp;#x200B;

N.B. my pros and cons listed are from my ignorance of these centers and my limited research, I hope by posting here i may gather further information helpful to make my decision.

170,"Just wanted to contribute my experience with mother aya after a retreat at hummingbird. Cannot recommend the place enough. The actual medicine aside, the whole experience was imbued with so much profundity and ritual and I was grateful to even set foot in the maloca or to listen to an icaro. Regardless...

I had previously been lacking that substantial connection to the mysterious and spiritual quality of existence- that alogical quality that blankets every experience but has been habitually ignored out of laziness or fear. Within the ceremony, from the moment I first gulped the juice, there was a tangible resonance within my psyche affirming this pivotal experience as one of spiritual magnitude. 

Abiding the advice proposed to me, my intention was plain and clear, ""Heal me and teach me"". From then on through 4 ceremonies, I become intimately familiar with this mother figure, although honestly I wonder how much was my personal projection clouding the experience. When I asked her to be gentle, she nurtured me like a child, when I asked her to give me space, she withdrew and let me sit and ponder. 

I was very scared as I had never done a full dose of any hallucinogen before. The beginning of the ceremony was quite anxiety inducing. The pitch black except for faint moonlight splayed on the maloca wall, the heaviness of the chanting of the icaro, the pungent smell of the mapacho, the foul taste of the medicine oozing inside your throat and esophagus, this impending sense of the most intense unknowns. All you could do was sit and pray as humbly as possible knowing your locus of control will soon be unabashedly usurped. 

The time before the medicine kicked in was such an intimate moment every ceremony for me because I was able to develop a practice of true surrender based in trust. For the first time in a long time, I learned to trust the medicine and trust my incarnation. 

One night, for some reason I had the last scene of the black mirror christmas episode in my head and I knew that if she wanted to, she could torture me to that degree.  So I told her over and over again how terrified I was of her. The fact that she would have total control of my body and mind was much more terrifying for me than expected. The shaman continued to tell me in the morning meetings that there is no reason to be afraid and that perhaps it is this fear that gets in the way of the experience. 

Slowly over the ceremonies I learned trust. She was like my mother teaching me how to walk for the first time. I saw I have so much unconscious and primal fear of all the things in the world that are unknown to me, but she showed me the fundamental benevolence of world, and that I can really trust a lot more than I do. Just like mother aya, the world is not there to punish you. She and it are there to teach you out of an act of true motherly benevolence. I learned that there are times when things can get really dreadfully uncomfortable, but you trust that it is exactly what you need at that moment and it no longer becomes negative. 

In hindsight, my intense feeling of fear awaiting the ceremony was emblematic of my deep insecurity in regular life. This insecurity is attritutable, as I am now more aware, to my lack of trust in the universe/god/the spiritual coating of existence. The lesson, then, is and always has been in the power of surrender to the eternal and unknowable force of life.

&amp;#x200B;

The top comment by \[deleted\] mentions the role of NMDA receptors in regulating tolerances to other drugs:  

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;From everything I have read NMDAR tolerance is the most permanent receptor tolerance there is. Since it is itself the receptor that controls tolerance reset, you have not just a tolerance, but a tolerance to the rate at which tolerance decreases. 

&amp;#x200B;

I would like to know if there is any evidence, scientific or anecdotal, to support this claim. It's scary to imagine building a permanent tolerance to the decrease of tolerances. 

&amp;#x200B;

Another question: is there believed to be a rebound effect from NMDA antagonism? Similar to GABAergics, are you left with the opposite effects of dissociation following the drug experience? Could this fuck with your glutamate system, causing it to be overactive? And if there *are* rebound effects, does the existence of perma-tolerance indicate long-lasting or even permanent rebound effects?

So, I’ve been on antidepressants for years now. Currently I am on Wellbutrin/Bupropion SR 150mg 2x a day, which I am trying to taper off since I feel my life has been stable for a while now, I eat good and I go to the gym. I started antidepressants when I was 12, and just kinda stayed on them and did not know it wasn’t something I don’t have to be on for the rest of my life. 

Consulted my doctor, the tapering schedule he suggested seemed too quick for me, so I’ve decided to go slower. I quit Cymbalta cold turkey twice in the past and do not want to experience that again. I did 75% of a pill twice a day for 3 weeks and I actually felt better than I did with the full dosage, which gave me some hope that the taper will be good for me. I’ve been at 50% of a pill twice a day for 5 days, and it honestly has been terrible. Very agitated and irritated, random headaches. The weird thing is, is that I noticed my breasts leaking a milky discharge since tapering, and I’ve experienced vaginal dryness and lowered sex drive, which is not fun at all. I am not pregnant. I’m more upset over the latter compared to the irritation and headaches.

Frantically searching the internet (not initially thinking it had to do with my meds) I learned that increased dopamine lowers prolactin, a hormone responsible for the lactating and dryness/lowered sex drive. I’m assuming that tapering off of Wellbutrin, which operates on dopamine receptors, lowers my dopamine and thus increases the prolactin. Okay. So, my question is, do I finish the taper and hope my body will level itself out? I’m very afraid that I will finish, but still be left with the agitation, shot sex drive, and vaginal dryness. I don't know whether to think these are simply withdrawal symptoms, or what my base level is.

My past 2 doses I went back up to 75% because I’m stupid, so it’s been about 16 ish hrs since going up and my sex drive feels fine now, and I don’t feel agitated. I have headaches, but I figured that much. I’m nervous that I do actually have to stay on it, especially considering I’ve been on some sort of pill for 10 years. Do I finish the taper?

180,"I had been posting a lot here lately leading up to my first Ayahuasca retreat, expressing my concerns about whether or not I was making the right decision, and wondering whether or not this would help. It has been three weeks since I have gotten back from Peru. I want to share my experience and ask for some advice.

So, the first ceremony was terrifying for me. I was given half a cup of Ayahuasca, and for the first hour and a half I wasn't really feeling anything. When the effects finally began to hit, they hit me pretty hard and fast. My body began to feel a bit buzzy, I was hearing a high\-pitch ringing in my ears, and eventually I reached a point where I was no longer able to feel my body. I had felt similar sensations like these before, so I didn't panic yet. I did start to panic, however, when I felt my ego being completely torn away from me. I kept trying to fight to be part of reality, but it felt like I was just fading out. I was frightened that if I let go, I was going to die or that I wouldn't come back. I called one of the retreat coordinators to come over and help me, and they just tried to talk me through what was happening and tell me that I'm safe.

After feeling like this for about two hours, and still not purging, I asked one of them to bring me outside the maloka for a bit since I was freaking out being in the dark. I was outside pretty much expressing my fears of dying \(which we discovered has been a pretty massive fear for me a lot of my life\), and after a bit of talking they gave me a bottle of water to chug. After drinking it I was pretty much able to immediately purge \(and it was a lot\). I calmed down a bit after that and just went to sleep in the maloka.

The next ceremony \(two days later\), I only took a quarter of a cup since half a cup was way too intense for me. This made it a lot easier for me to focus on what I needed to focus on. I actually spent most of this night sitting outside the maloka just thinking to myself and talking to one of the retreat coordinators. I thought a lot about family, and how much I really needed to make things better back at home. This was a really recurrent thought throughout the entire thing. I also came to the conclusion that night that I was done. Not only with Ayahuasca, but with psychedelics. For the past year, I've been experimenting with psychedelics quite a bit, and I think for the next few years I'm going to stop and just focus on integrating now. I feel like I've learned what I needed to learn. So I didn't actually drink Ayahuasca on the third and final ceremony.

Now, here is an update of how I have felt since coming back home. The first week, the afterglow was very strong. I was feeling a lot better. My mood definitely improved quite a bit, my anxiety was lower, and I pretty much felt ready to overcome my issues. Right now, at the three\-week mark, I'm not so sure anymore. There have been a couple of days since coming back where I have woken up in the morning and felt depressed still. Like, I didn't want to get out of bed. I was shocked to still be feeling that. I think my anxiety still has been taken down a notch, but still isn't totally better.

I had a bit of a rough night with friends last night that felt me feeling pretty shitty about myself, and I'm almost beginning to doubt that I actually have what it takes to get better. Once or twice I've even had fleeting suicidal thoughts. Nothing serious that I think I would act on, but they've been there. Today, I actually considered that maybe I should just give SSRIs a shot after all and see what happens.

Now, I will admit that I may have slacked a bit on the integration, which might be part of the issue. The main things I have been consistent with are being closer with my family and appreciating them more. I've been a lot more open, and let out a lot of suppressed emotion I've had, which has helped me out with them a bit. I've tried improving my diet a bit too. The biggest dietary change I made was cutting out red meat and pork. There is a lot of stuff that I haven't been doing, though. I wanted to start meditating daily, which I haven't actually been doing. Although I've made a few dietary changes, I'll admit I still haven't been eating all that great. Finally, my sleep schedule and productivity haven't been the greatest. There are still a lot of nights where I'm up until 3 or 4 in the morning, and sleeping in until noon or even later. I'm aware Ayahuasca isn't a miracle cure, and that I still have to put in a lot of work myself, so maybe this is why I'm experiencing some difficulties now.

So, that was pretty much my experience with Ayahuasca. I learned a lot, but to be completely honest, I don't know how to proceed from here. Maybe I should just go with SSRIs, or maybe I should just try integrating a healthier lifestyle a bit better. Thanks for reading this.",Ayahuasca,My Ayahuasca Experience

Before my actual question please read about my situation right now.

I am in a very introspective state lately. Had a depressive episode, many sleepless days after breaking out of depression because I can't unwind. I learned a lot in the past 2 years about myself but my psyche can't follow up. It's like a back and forth between depressive and overly euphoric phases in my life. I struggle with detaching from events in my life, especially interactions with people close to me. Family and Friends  love me the way I am but I don't take care of my own mental struggle. I'm too interested in the well-being of others rather than mine which made me awesome in the outside but sad and lost in the inside. I know it's because I am insecure about myself. I can't unwind and enjoy little things and don't know if the path I'm on is right. I feel like I only do it to make my family happy but I know I shouldn't feel that way. I have awesome requirements for a proper education and I know I have the brains for it but it feels like I have a baggage of an unpleasant past I can't  digest. Until I was 19 I was the mostly ignorant and was gaming addicted. I changed in a way I can't comprehend, but I think the general issue is, as stated, my constant overthinking. I have high expectations of the ceremony and I'm anxious about the outcome. What if it doesn't work? Will the truth change my life in a bad way? I have no energy left for a major change in my life.

I attended a retreat a year ago in peru.  My life had become untenable, and I was desperate for a new beginning.  My experience in peru were extraordinary in several impossible to describe ways: painful and beautiful, so so real, deep and confusing, at times sinister, otherworldly,  and enduring.   Over the year since, I continue to feel ayahuascas precense and influence, sometimes in astonishing ways, almost as immersive as when I was in Peru.     For the first 6 months since, I felt as though I was deeply connected to the universe.  I was felt smarter, more creative, more loving, more wise.   I made some dramatic life changes: forsook a career that had become wrong and then damaging for me, moved to a new country with my partner, quit smoking, quit smoking weed, and drinking.  

My life has certainly changed.  And it looks like the new beginning I was hoping for, I find myself thinking: OK... Now what?

I've unpacked a lot, but after a year, it's becoming clear that I have a lot more trauma to unpack.  And I'm thinkin, jeez, is this ever going to end?

In terms of how the high feels subjectively, I’d say it feels almost like I’ve popped a couple of valiums but without the weird kind of spaciness that benzos give you. It’s super clear headed, and despite feeling super heavily sedated I’ve still managed to work consistently and without hiccups all day. I’ve finished up work and am just playing vidya in between typing this out. Woke up from a nap about an hour ago and could definitely fall back asleep, but don’t have to fight the urge to do so. 

Anyway, sorry if this post is disorganised or rambling. Hope this post helps anyone looking into experimenting with different types of poppies or just sleuthing.

199,"A lot of medications, especially those treating anxiety and depression, seem to target and antagonize certain auto receptors like serotonin and dopamine receptors. 

For example, Buspar is an anxiety drug used in conjunction with antidepressants. It targets and antagonizes the 5HT-1A auto receptors and well as D2 and other dopamine auto receptors. I understand why auto receptors are often the ""bad guy"" in clinical practice as they prevent medications from taking full effect in a shorter time span. 

However, auto receptors exist for a reason. They exist as part of your brain's drive to regulate what it thinks in the ""correct"" amount of a chemical. I feel like chronically antagonizing these is a bad thing but haven't found much data to support it. I have read that antagonizing the 5HT-2A receptor (another favorite clinical target) reduces receptors density. 

Are there any consequences for screwing with auto receptors over the long term? And if so what are they in terms of clinical significance? ",DrugNerds,Are there pharmacological consequences of antagonizing auto-receptors?

207,"**Death.** I remember that it felt like death. I remember losing my mind, like it wasn't even possible to let go of my own identity. It was as if my idea of self has been erased, journeying me into a dark abyss moving farther from my physical body. It felt dark. I saw spirits dancing as the shamans were playing some sort of spiritual sound. They were talking to me, like someone whom I knew for a long time; telling me all my dark thoughts. They were a reflection of myself. 

**The Journey.** The Ayahuasca experience allowed me to speak with my subconscious, opening all the desires I've ever wanted to see. Expecting a lot from the experience, I was told to give an intention before drinking the sacred Ayahuasca tea. The intention is to determine what the visions might appear in your trip. Without any knowledge on what it would turn out to be, I simply said, “Show me what life should be like and go easy on me.” Fasting for a week is required to have a very meaningful and spiritual trip. It is normal for people that drink it to vomit due to its acidity. 

As I vomit what felt like the last remaining liquid inside my body, I released all my negative energy, or ego, or maybe all the desires and pleasures I wish were part of my natural self, like it was all gone. It was symbolic and sacred. Tribes from Peru have done this practice as a form of cleansing the soul. I may have thrown my negative energy out verbally, for all the people in the ceremony to hear. There was one instance when I just had to release all the sexual tension I was feeling towards a woman in the ceremony, and later on realized that it was embarrassing. Aya taught me that there was nothing to feel ashamed about as I was just being myself, trying to release all the pleasures I was craving on. At least I knew then that what I did was of good will to procreate. I could have hurt her, but I didn’t because it was not in my nature to do so. No one is perfect. We are all flawed. Cleansed and healed from the negative energy, it felt liberating. My ego was stripped away, and it felt like I didn't need it to define who I am. I was able to observe my usual thinking patterns and needed some reframing. I feel better, like a person reborn from all energies merged into one body. 

**The psychedelic experience.** The earlier phases of my journey felt like my spirit left my body. Colors of green, red and yellow were all I could see regardless whether or not my eyes were closed. I saw the eye of providence and an image of a pyramid, both of which were dancing in translucent colors. Images of eyes, much like the all seeing eye in a one dollar bill, were looking at me as if they were observing my thought patterns. It was scary and amusing at the same time. I feel like the all seeing eye is always present in any psychedelic episode because we see the nature of a person just by looking at him straight in the eye. Our subconscious is telling us that the eye sees through one’s spirit. 

**The spirit realm.** Towards the middle of my trip was when I felt my spirit lingering in the spirit realm. The shaman, who acted as a medium between the physical and spiritual realm, was responsible for keeping me near the physical realm, so I would not be lost in the abyss. Scary as it may seem, I felt both dead and alive at the same time. As I felt my thoughts grow darker, I had a very difficult time finding the light. I have seen spirits inside the room. One was beside me, the other standing across the room. A hint of consciousness is telling me not to look them in the eye in fear of something worse than just looking at them. I am not even entirely sure if they were human, maybe elves possibly. All I know is that they were there in the moment of my active spiritual side. During the absence of my consciousness, I saw a wolf that guided me back to the shaman. It may even be possible that the wolf might be my spirit animal, channeling both our inner instincts as living creatures and how I eerily resemble its characteristics toward the light. I was hallucinating and felt euphoria at some point in my trip. Later on, I felt a source of energy that brought me back to my physical body. It was liberating. I felt recollected with my conscious being, but that didn’t last long. 

The fruit I was holding felt slightly larger than what would have been normal when seen by the sober eye. The first bite felt like bliss, like I was ascending my reality onto the fruit. The trip that felt like 3 hours in my mind, actually was just an hour on the clock. This realization had me thinking that time is just a concept. It does not exist within our minds if we choose to be in the present moment. The feeling of being recollected with my conscious being was short and sudden, then later on transcended into a mental loop. 

**The mental loop.** This was the scariest experience I have ever had in my entire physical, emotional and spiritual life. As the term implies, my thoughts were repetitive. A feeling you get when you think of going outside a door, only to find out that once you open it, you're back to the thought of just about to turn the knob. Think of the movie Insidious and the concept of Astral Projection. It’s creepily similar to what I encountered and believe me, it was real. This may have a relation with letting go of the ego. I had a very hard time letting go a part of myself that it took me a longer time to transcend to a higher being. This part of myself was definitely the ego. I was in a constant battle with myself, trying to avoid being selfless because I thought I valued that part of my identity the most. If I let go of my attachments sooner, the mental loop could have been cut short, but it didn't because it was one of my most valued parts of my identity. This was the part when I've been hearing my demons speak to me, telling me that I'm always high with a very sinister laugh (I smoke too much weed on a regular basis as part of my identity.) Not the type of demon you see on horror movies, I've come to realize that the demons were a part of myself, a dark side of myself, speaking to me at the time of my hallucination. Eventually I just had to let go, even if it literally felt like death, otherwise I would have been stuck in the mental loop for a longer time. No living creature would like to experience it for fun. Once I did let go of the self, I felt like a spiritual being transcended into a philosophical turbine of introspection and realizations on life. 

**The stage of enlightenment.** I felt connected with everyone. Humans, animals, plants. I felt like we are all connected from the same root with similar energies. I saw visions that cannot be seen by our very own human eyes. I’ve been blessed by the substance with the ability to see that humans should not act like gods because we are all equal. I felt like a god at some point of this enlightenment, being able to see how humans are connected with our ability to feel collectively conscious with one another despite differences. It felt good, but too much vision had me thinking, at the end of this all, we are still flawed humans. Similar to what our structure in this world is happening right now, in this capitalist world, people are driven by their egos. We think we are human when we feel stuck, when we feel pride, when we are jealous, when self- importance feels like our drive for success. That is how we want to act as gods. Anything pleasurable in excess is destructive, even desires more so. Ego has taken over our way of life. The visions I saw are correct, and it saddens me how we feel like this is the way to live. We cannot blame ourselves for this kind of thinking because we were raised as such. 

I felt that balance in life is very important. Balance is key to handling a satisfying life. Ego, the natural self, the pleasures and desires in life, the negative energies: all these should be in equal proportions. Anything exceeding the other will lead to an unsatisfying craving in life. By stripping away our ego, desires and pleasures, we become selfless as Aya taught us how we should be as living creatures, to ascend to higher consciousness. We become higher beings if we let go of the idea of the self, giving up our desires and worldly materialistic attachments. Without attachments, we are able to see the truth in our humanistic nature: that is to be loving of one another and to be accepting of each other despite our inequality based on our upbringing. If we strip away our desire for personal gain, I am certain that you will feel much more altruistic and free, in the process of attracting love like moths to a flame. 

If we get attached to our ego and let it consume our day to day living, we get to live a life of jealousy and dissatisfaction, because we are always in search of something that would make us feel superior to other people. The media has been lying to us all along. They keep telling us that materialistic attachments are important to satisfy our needs, because we fear that we may not be connected with others if we don't have this specific need to buy something. This is the very desire of capitalism. Fear sells. That is why we crave for material possessions. If the metric to having a good life is based on material wealth grounded in this earth, then that is not a very good way to live. In fact, there is no good life. There is no good life, without experiencing first the bad. That is what Aya has taught me. Balance -- benevolence and malevolence, it is within our nature to feel both. If we set goals solely based on material wealth, then the chance of having a midlife crisis is like your close relative eagerly waiting for you at the airport that once met, there is nothing else but to think to yourself, ""now what?"" Goals should be about developing the self through constant learning and improvement from personal experiences and learnings from other people. 

**In search of meaning.** I learned that ego will always be within us as it is part of our human nature to feel these desires. We cling onto ego because it feels good. It empowers us and makes us think that we can achieve greater things. What made me realize later on is that we get to choose how we remain associated with these desires, or let go and let live. Life is an everlasting rollercoaster of temptations and pleasures, which we can never avoid. However, if we become open to others, not thinking about taking advantage of them for personal gain, we become selfless. We are able to see the world within our own universe: that life is not meant to be feared from what people view us to be. Life is meant to be understood from the universe within our minds. We should not let others define our identity because if we know (and love) ourselves well enough, there won't be any constant search of approval from others. 

**Love is the message.** I wish to become a more hyper intuitive version of myself from this point forward, though I must admit there are certain times my thoughts keep bringing me back to the systemized version of myself prior to the spiritual ceremony. I hope you take my philosophy with a grain of salt because each life experience is different. 

We never had the same upbringing, but as humans, our nature is to feel the same, to feel one with everyone. I thank Ayahuasca for the very life changing spiritual experience. For those who are still deciding whether or not they should widen their horizons, I highly recommend exploring your thoughts. The experience is not for the most upright people, but it would definitely help them the most as they get to learn more about themselves, especially the thoughts that can't be heard by the conscious mind. Life is about love, and not the ego running it around. The ego is a distraction and a lesson in itself. That attachments don't define who they are. That it is just a validation of one's identity. Be selfless. Be loving. Be accepting. I hope to see your views in the higher state. ",Ayahuasca,A Comprehensive Account of My Experience With Ayahuasca

---

""The human mind is complex. I’ve spoken with you before about how a person’s brain is merely a processing plant. A person is born from his mother’s womb, with his parents’ flesh and blood, and then grows by consuming earthly foods. And at death, whether he’s buried in the earth or cremated, he turns to dust. The brain itself, strictly speaking, is not the origin of one’s thoughts. Don’t people have a soul? Doesn’t a person’s body also consist of a part that is at various microscopic layers and that isn’t in the surface dimension? All of those can generate thoughts. Some people have said that the human body is a miniature universe. Think about how many cells are contained in a person’s brain. And how many molecules make up those cells?

And how many even more minuscule particles make up those molecules? Each minuscule particle, as positioned in space, looks as does a celestial body to the human eye. Everyone looks outwardly. Every planet in this greater universe has life on it, only it’s not in this surface dimension and thus it’s invisible to you. America’s space technology is said to be so advanced, yet when they land on other planets they see nothing there but a desolate world. But it is not desolate there; it’s just that man’s technology is too shallow. How many planets are there in this universe? The cells, molecules, and more minuscule particles in the human brain have the same arrangement as that of the universe that we see, and even the sequencing is the same. How many particles are there in your human body?

How many planets are there inside your brain? If the lives on those minuscule particles (that is, planets) were to look upon the particles spread throughout the space of the brain, would it be any different from how human beings look at planets or the universe? If you are to look at it this way, doesn’t a person’s brain contain a large universe? And how many beings, how many gods, and how many still greater beings exist there in those dimensions? Given that all of those countless beings have their own minds, where exactly do humans’ thoughts come from? It’s extraordinarily complex.""

232,"Putting my own personal motivations aside, the attraction to selective androgen receptor modulators or SARMS is quite obvious - (in theory) they are supposed to give Steroid like gains without being as physically damaging. I did quite extensive research including reading through the very limited literature on human use of these drugs. I will briefly outline the major reasons why I don't think anyone who is attempting to make an objective decision about their health.

To start,  I should note that while there are many drugs sold under the title of SARMS; there are a number of drugs (Mk677, GW etc) which have different mechanisms of action.

The most fundamental selling point of SARMS is that they (a) produce steroid like effects and (b) do not possess the same side effects. Anyone who has done 5 minutes of research into SARMS will notice that it's actually very difficult to find reliable logs of people using these drugs with any great effect. The overwhelming consensus is that their effects are fairly mild - even for the stronger ones. The only studies on SARMS in humans were for MK-2866 aka Ostarine to treat Cachexia, or muscle wasting during cancer.  The doses used were significantly lower than those suggested for muscle gain and the patient population used in these studies were elderly women. Even at these low doses - side effects were observed.  Just because Ostarine prevented muscle wasting in elderly women this does not mean that taking 10x the amount will add muscle to a healthy young man.

I just want to make this clear because it's so often spoke about as if people know what they're talking about. The reality is there is next to NO research done on these drugs meaning by taking these drugs, you are conducting the first human trials.

What is increasingly common is reports of people who've had blood work done and had elevated liver enzymes, bad lipid profiles and suppressed hormones.  If you look on the internet, the ONLY people who talk about the benefits of SARMS are those trying to sell them - which is why chemicals which are not SARMS have been lumped in with them - as a way to capitalise on the marketing.  These people exploit the knowledge that there are lots of young people like myself who want to believe in something that's going to replace hard work and time with no side effects. But that is not how the real world works and as any pharmacologist knows - that's not how drugs work.  To suggest that SARMS will not suppress/shut down your endogenous production of test is just wrong - that's not how your bodies negative feedback loop works.  A big part of my rational for looking into them was the belief that they would not shut down my own production - but to really think this is true is just naive.

In addition to this, the SARMS being sold are notoriously impure and there is a good chance you're either receiving nothing at all or something more harmful. I think a big reason why people end up taking these is because they desperately want to believe that their is a short-cut. I did. But the more I looked into it the more I realised that it just wasn't worth it. In the future these might be worth pursuing but at the current time it's just not a smart choice.

tldr;

\&gt; There is extremely limited data on the effects and side effects of these drugs in humans

\&gt; People commonly report steroid like suppression, effects on cholesterol and elevated lipid values

\&gt; Finding even anecdotal evidence of the efficacy of these SARMS is difficult

\&gt; There is a good probability you will either not receive what you ordered or something much more toxic

\*\*noticed the giant shit-storm in the comments lol. I am not telling people what they should/shouldn't do with their body - just the conclusions I came to in researching these and why they weren't right for me. 

If you are going to make big claims you have to have the evidence to back this up - very little exists.

236,"I see it mentioned here a lot, everyone suggesting not to do any drugs including marijuana for ideally 2 weeks prior to a ceremony. Usually the tone I get is one of condemning weed as just any other drug on the same level as alcohol and cocaine. Of course a lot use weed for purely recreation and may even be dependent on it, but there are others who use weed as an entheogen.

Personally it helped heal me quite a bit form past trauma, not just while high but it slowly changed my day to day personality and I’ve become a much kinder and happier person because of it.

I have a 2 night ceremony coming up in a few months (my first) and I definitely intend to follow the diet strictly. If it means having to do without weed then so be it, but since I would prefer to use it till a week before, I just want to know what the reason for the marijuana  restriction is. Is it just tradition or does the energies / archetypes of the two plants not vibe well with one another?",Ayahuasca,Does Ayahuasca have a bad affinity with Marijuana?
237,"If you had to choose between these 2 options, which would you choose and why?

&amp;#x200B;

***You don't have to read this first paragraph.*** 4 days ago I took \~130mg MDMA with my girlfriend in our apartment. It was our second time taking it, the first time being a month ago (I know, I know. I miscalculated like the dumbass I am and I thought 2 months had passed). I took everything that I should've taken, and ate extremely healthily (like tons of fruit and stuff) in the days prior to consumption. It was SO fucking intense. **WAY** more intense than my first time, which was \~120mg. Very sure I had a much more intense experience than my gf too. 10mg difference doesn't account for how much more fucking intense the peak was. I can't even describe it, on my first time (which everyone says is usually the best) I could kind of imagine it being more intense, even though it was already unbelievably intense. This time I couldn't imagine it, and I wouldn't want it more intense if it could be. I was fucking incapacitated with pleasure. Had a nice 2 day afterglow, until I had to go back to work which I hate intensely, making me feel depressed. I'm pretty sure it's work and not the latent M comedown, but I'm not 100% sure.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, took the supplements like Na-R-ALA, NAC, 5HTP EGCG, vit C, multiple glasses of grapefruit juice and an actual grapefruit, and so on, you know the drill, all with good timings. **My question is: we went to bed soon after the experience ended (had a lot of vivid hypnagogic visualisations while trying to sleep lmao); I woke up a few times hot and a bit sweaty, not because of the drug or whatever, but because our room was hot.

248,"Hi all.

First off I want to say, there is a pretty significant mistake in the title of this post and I don't see how to change it.  It's supposed to say tripped withOUT psychedelics.  

&amp;#x200B;

This is a crazy story.  But I am honestly telling the truth, even if it doesn't make much sense.  I'm just trying to figure out what happened to me.

&amp;#x200B;

A little background about myself.  I am female, in my 30s.  Had mental health issues my entire life, but feel like I've gotten them under control with years of therapy, meditation, mindfulness, and occasional use of psychedelics, mainly Ayahuasca.  A year and a half ago I had an IUD inserted.  Since then, I have a period about every 6 months.  But the PMS I have before it is awful.  And I do mean AWFUL.  Like, wishing I was dead, praying for a car accident on the way to work, not wanting to get out of bed awful.  I have considered going on short term low doses of antidepressants during these times at the advice of my doctor, just to make it so I can function through them.  I am generally against psych drugs... but I am also against wanting to die and wishing for bad things to happen to me for about 10 days every 6 months.

&amp;#x200B;

So, last week was one of these awful PMS episodes.  All week long I was just trying to function.  I didn't want to eat.  Didn't want to get out of bed, etc.  But I made myself go through the day to day.  Every year around this time for the past several years I have attended Ayahuasca ceremonies.  But this year I decided to skip out on that.  Lack of money and a busy work schedule. etc.  I still felt like I was being called to do it again.  But just didn't have the means/time.

&amp;#x200B;

So, Friday Morning at work I was having an absolute meltdown at work.  I was struggling really hard to keep my emotions in check.  Bursting out crying in the workplace isn't an acceptable thing...  On my break I went in the bathroom and called my boyfriend.  I told him I just couldn't get it together.  I was having an emotional meltdown.  I felt like I was going to puke.  I was shaking, crying, heart rate was through the roof.  He helped me calm down and I finished out the work day the best I could.

&amp;#x200B;

After work he picked me up and we went to run some errands.  I was talking to him about the low doses of antidepressants that have been suggested to me.  And I was saying maybe I should try that.  But at some point I got the bright idea to get some Midol and try that first.  I haven't taken Midol is like ten years.  Last time I took it I got a really upset stomach.  But honestly, I would rather have that then crushing depression for days.  So, I got the Midol and a bottle of wine and a Hershey bar, joking with him about how I was getting a PMS survival kit.  (I promise all this will be relevant here in bit.  I'm not rambling.)

&amp;#x200B;

So, I took the Midol in the car and went on about my business.  I had been drinking Tea all day at work, like I usually do.  The Tea is caffeinated, and I had no idea Midol had caffeine in it when I took it.  So... there is this family owned coffee shop we like to go to when in that part of town.  So we stopped there and got coffees.  They had 32 oz iced mochas on special.  We each got one.  I have never drank a mocha that big.  But I thought nothing of it.  I drank it.

&amp;#x200B;

We had to go back to my house so I could change and get my stuff.  I was staying with him that night.  Now this is where things get weird...  But I swear I'm not lying.  On the way back to my house I started fucking tripping.  I swear to all the Gods.

&amp;#x200B;

I started seeing colors and fractals everywhere.  I was experiencing weird tactile sensations as well that are similar to those I've experienced on Ayahuasca.  I have done Ayahuasca 7 times, just so everyone has an idea.  I'm not a novice user.  And a few of those times have been very high doses with out of body experiences and one of them included complete loss of reality and ego death.

&amp;#x200B;

So, we get back to my house.  I am having trouble walking.  I sat in my bathroom right inside the door.  I kept wanting to just lay on the bathroom floor but stopped myself.  I couldn't take a shower.  I felt like I was going to puke so I drank some soda water.  It didn't help much.

&amp;#x200B;

I somehow manged to get my stuff gathered and we loaded it into the car.  We headed to his place.  I just felt completely raw.  The fractals and colors continued during the car ride.  It was dark out by now and everything was so vivid.  I just closed my eyes and figured if this is going to happen I might as well enjoy it.  But then I felt myself starting to leave my body.  And I panicked.  My bf knew what was going on.  I told him I felt an OBE coming on and felt like I was losing any sense of reality.

&amp;#x200B;

We got back to his house.  It was pouring rain.  We went inside and I laid on his bed.  I felt like I could fall asleep.  But I was terrified to go to sleep because I felt like if I went to sleep I would never wake up.  This is something I have dealt with a lot during ceremonies.  My body wants to sleep but I am convinced I will die if I sleep, etc.  I laid on his bed struggling with this.  He as there with me and I told him I didn't want to sleep.  I told him I didn't ask for this.  I said I felt like I was being raped in my mind.  Because I did.  I was furious that this was happening and I didn't ask for it.  I didn't take anything expecting to trip.  I thought about going into the bathroom and making myself puke.  But I didn't think I had the strength to physically get up and walk down the hall.  I also thought about going to the ER, but I knew there wasn't anything they could do other than shoot me up with more drugs and have me sleep it off.

&amp;#x200B;

So I just laid on his bed freaking out for a while.  This whole experience was eerily similar to an ayahuasca experience.  But I don't see how that's even possible.  The bodily sensations were the same.  The disjointed thought processes were the same.  But there was no purge and no feeling of Euphoria as a reward after all the hell.

&amp;#x200B;

Then I remembered the wine I bought.  I felt like the wine was the only thing that could help.  And I know how dysfunctional and fucked up that is.  I don't have any problems with alcohol, never have.  But to me it's just really fucked up that I'm tripping out of nowhere and the only thing I can think to do is drink wine to stop it.  It was still in the car.  I got dressed and went outside in the pouring rain in the middle of the night in my bare feet and got the wine out of the car.  I poured myself a glass and went upstairs.  I sat on his bed and drank it and immediately felt better.   The trip didn't stop.  I was still tripping.  But the anxiety stopped and I was able to relax and go to sleep.  I had been up for 22 hours straight by that point.

&amp;#x200B;

The next day I felt emotionally raw and experienced some residual effects just like (and I bet you don't see this one coming a mile away) the effects I feel after an Ayahuasca ceremony.

&amp;#x200B;

I have no idea.  And I know this doesn't make any sense to anyone probably.  But I swear the whole thing is true.  Coffee, Midol, PMS...  tripping out of nowhere.

&amp;#x200B;

I know there are some people who regard Ayahuasca as an actual spirit.  I have always had a more skeptical way of thinking when it comes to that.  After this I am wondering, lol.  If there is an actual spirit there it could have decided it was going to have a go at me whether I wanted it or not, lol.  I am still a skeptic, but that puts an interesting angle on the whole thing.  Or maybe I'm just crazy and was having a psychotic episode.  Joking aside, I am genuinely worried about the second option.

280,"I'm writing a little memo/listicle about drugs that reduce, prevent, and/or reverse tolerance to some of the main classes of euphoric drugs. 

I am very curious if you know of any pharmaceutical, plant or research chemical that has this property. So far here is what I've found to be the most promising leads:

1) Ibogaine - seems to up-regulate mu-opioid receptors

2) Proglumide - a CCKa and CCKb antagonist, which regulates endorphin tolerance 

3) Ultra-low dose naltrexone - for some unknown reason an opioid antagonist in vanishingly small doses seems to have mu-opioid receptor up-regulating effects

Also intriguing, but less impressive, are compounds like agmatine and dxm which reduce opioid tolerance in a mild way. Additionally, tianeptine sulfate is a great anti-depressant with a mechanism of action tied to the mu-opioid receptor. Unlike other ""hard pain killers"" like morphine, tianeptine is a delta opioid agonist and that seems to prevent the buildup of tolerance to the mu subtype when taken at therapeutic doses (people still get addicted to tianeptine if they take 10-100X the therapeutic dose, though). Salvinorin A is a kappa opioid agonist and in small daily doses seems to improve mood long term (this is only anecdotal, though). And finally, the selective kappa opiod antagonist JDTid seems to improve mood in people with certain depression subtypes, and was investigated as an anti-depressant.

285,"Where do I begin?

First things first, I feel sick. Spiritually, mentally, and emotionally, I feel sick. I do not feel in touch with a higher purpose or meaning in my life - I feel like a lost soul roaming this earth, attempting to fill an insatiable void constantly. I feel like there is more to my existence than what my life is now. 

I get that I am a high schooler and no one understands the meaning of their life in high school, but that's not relevant at this point. I have so much psychic gunk that I resent and want to expel... Mother Ayahuasca can help me with that. And let me make this clear, I don't want to sound self-absorbed and egotistical by saying this, I just genuinely think this is true: I am an old soul. I do not feel like a young kid and never have. I struggle to find the words to explain my life and soul to you, but I think that my dad has deep-rooted problems that he passed down to me, which he is unwilling to confront.. but I am. We have the same huge ego as a defense mechanism, the same loathing of our body, and the same constant thinking and introspection, HOWEVER, it appears that his heart and mind have been hardened to protect himself. I don't want that to be me forever, because it is me right now.

Now, the specific problems that plague me:

For starters, besides the conflict at home that I'll explain soon, I am very narcissistic. Not in a self-glorifying way, though - I'm constantly checking - and loathing - my appearance in the mirror and worrying about the reaction and approval I'll get from others in my words and actions. I am in a CONSTANT, EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING state of introspection and thinking and I have grown to despise it. I have always been a thinker, but my mind has gone to the dumps. I have become a negative, self-absorbed ruminator.

I went through a lot of traumatizing things as a young kid, not on the level of incidental severe abuse, but more on the level of daily, negative mental conditioning from living in a very volatile, high-stress, high-conflict household. I lived under constant belittling and negativity from my older brother and witnessed intense, familial fights that left me emotionally numb and depersonalized. I remember on Christmas, which is also my mother's birthday, my brother, mother, and father had the most intense, brutal fight about the dumbest thing and I just felt broken inside. I laid on the bed when it was all over and tried to cry, but I just couldn't. My brain derealized to protect me, but I am done living in this haze. 

Lastly, I have been in a nearly perpetual state of existential depression. From the age of 11-13 I questioned my Catholic upbringing, and eventually realized it's not really for me. Then, in sophomore year of high school, I began to realize how many pointless things humanity fills their life up with. I began to wonder: What are we distracting ourselves from? What void are we trying to fill? What is the meaning of all this? I have a strong, intuitive suspicion that there is more to this reality and this one is just a part of a much bigger picture, which creates this realization that me going to school everyday to learn about complete and utter bullshit that doesn't matter is meaningless. I have had a vacuum of meaninglessness sucking away at my soul for the past few years. I am done. There is more to this life that Ayahuasca can show me.

With all of this eating away at me, I have always turned to vices to distract myself from myself. Whether it be binge eating and internet addiction since the age of 9, or consuming self-destructive amounts of porn, or escaping from this reality with weed or psychedelics, even on-and-off dieting and excessive video game use, I have always been addicted to something. I want to truly know WHY because I DON'T and it is so frustrating and soul-eating. Over the past 5 months I have been trying SO hard to quit porn but I haven't gone more than 27 days without... over the past three weeks I haven't been able to make it 3 days without. As we speak, I have given in twice today and probably will give in again right now even though I'm not aroused. 

I want to confront my past and see what I have become. I am a narcissistic, broken young man with a profound lack of meaning in his everyday life which I attempt to fill with vices. I want to submit myself and all of my brokenness to the healing power and knowledge of Mother Ayahuasca. I have every intention to heal. There is some fear that I'll go crazy, end up with stronger neurosis than before, or simply have a bad trip, but after researching and thinking, I think the medicine of Ayahuasca is what I need. Those fears have nearly vanished, and it's calling to me. What do I do? My parents certainly won't be on board - is it a waiting game until I'm 18 and self-sufficient? Can I do it covertly? SHOULD I do it covertly?

I am 6 days out from the start of my retreat. I'm having serious second thoughts about what I am getting into. I knew when I signed up that Aya is a lot of work and requires deep commitment to healing/change and I am fully committed to changing my life to improve. But hearing the reports about post experience depression, anxiety and panic attacks really have me worried (as well as the risk of hppd and psychosis albeit very rare).

I am mild-moderately depressed and I am looking to reconnectt with my old self. Although I've been suffering the past few years, I still believe my life is good and I value a lot of what I have. Ive also realized that my depression is coming from being unhappy in the rat race, working a VERY demanding job and suppressing a lot of my personal desires to see the world, goof off and just have fun. I'm wound too tight. 

So is Aya what I truly need? I'm already certain of some changes I need to make in my life (overcoming fear is a whole another animal). Maybe psilocybin would help me in this journey with fewer risks?

Or maybe my ego is just scared and trying to talk me out of this experience? I ask these questions because I truly respect the medicine and do not want to be cavalier in the process. Any input would be greatly appreciated! Thank you all....This is an awesome community to be a part of.

292,"So I just recently finished a weekend retreat in the States, having a total experience of 4 cermonies (2 in the US and 2 in the Iquitos). While I did recieve some introspective insights, I can't help but feel that the Ayahuasca is very mild compare to my prior psychedelic experiences and not life changing as many people claim it is.

My ego remained completely intact in all my ceremonies, even after taken three dose of brew (spread out over the course of the night). I also recieved very little visual and became immediately sober after purging. My past ceremony I did recieve some introspection thought patterns that seem quite useful though nothing life changing like my experiences with mushrooms.

Is ayahuasca perhaps just not for me? I have a very low tolerance towards pretty much every other psych I tried (shrooms, lsd, salvia) and had some form profound experiences with every other substance. Part of me wants to try aya in the future but am hesitant as perhaps there's alternative ways that are a wiser use of my money to better myself internally.

Hello Universe, I am a 38 year old man living in Los Angeles CA. Last Thursday 03/01/18, after two days of searching for answers to a depression episode, my search brought me to Ayahuasca and I felt the calling. 

I've always been a very ""mental/mind"" person, I use my mind to create my future and my world. I can remember as far back as 11 years old sitting in the darkness in my room with my eyes closed visualizing my life and future. I saw with very great  clarity events that I feel I have grown up to live. I was led to reading at a young age and my favorite reads always were about self improvement, personal development, using your mind to become successful in life not just in money but in peace with yourself. The Universe became a thing to me, something that we could shape and harness if we knew the ways to ask and you respected the rules. I've shaped and created my world using my to visualize and asking questions inside. Without knowing I've used my own meditation to see what I wanted in my world and it would take shape around me. I have had incredible experiences and success in life being able to channel that vision correctly. Unfortunately from as far back as that time I also have had to struggle with depression and self doubt. The same mind that allows me to visualize good things in my life also punishes me with endless thoughts and questions with no where to find answers.  

Over the years I have I've tried many things to calm my mind and remove the dark cloud. Talk therapy, journaling, traveling across the world, extreme dedication to exercise and diet, abstinence from alcohol for extended periods of time, paying attention to getting enough sleep, visualizing positive things and results I want in my life. All of these things work and with discipline I have achieved much however when things get too good, or things are to perfect that is when I self sabotage, as if I feel I don't deserve to be that happy or that successful. Something inside me is not right and I have always known it, there is a pain, a guilt, a feeling of not being worthy of such success and happiness.  I have much to be grateful for, I have overcome many challenges in my life but it feels that I have to over compensate to be ""normal."" Most days I am exhausted mentally from having to ""perform"" for the world. The person I show the world is a performance and not myself. I can fool people for a long time, I've become very good at acting like the person I want to be but I'm tired, very tired of acting like him. I want to be him, or I want to be me and be OK with whatever that is. 

It is in this state of mind that I found myself in when I started seeing the documentaries and websites about Ayahuasca. Immediately my heart felt like it wanted to come out of my chest and move closer to the TV. Tears would flow as I listened to the testimonials and experiences others shared. It gave me hope, hope for mental and emotional peace. That is when I felt the calling but it was me wanting to be called, as I have my whole life, wanting to be called for a deeper purpose that gives reason to why I am the way I am. A reason for the mental anguish at times, the self doubt, and the depression yet the power to create, unite, and inspire at others. 

I started reaching out to friends who might have information. An intuition about them that told me they might have answers. I reached out to two friends one from Peru who has always been very spiritual and grounded from my perspective and another a woman who mentioned going away for spiritual healing some time ago. I didn't give away my intention right away when I asked them both about Spirituality, I simply asked them if they were still Spiritual both immediately asked me if I was thinking about doing Ayahuasca. through conversations with now 4 different people I feel that not only am I calling it but now it is calling me. Life has seemed to open itself up to me to allow for me to make a journey. In the middle of my frenzy I saw every angle where the Universe was constructing the road to Peru. As if my whole experience in life, career, experiences, and timing lead to now and to making this trip to find myself, heal myself, and to connect. 

As the work week begins I am afraid that I will lose this connection I feel I've found again, a connection to the calling, to the feeling that the universe is actually working and I am listening. Doubts have crept into my mind about who I will pull this trip off and the risks of everything that could go wrong. I feel its all valid but I also feel that this could be self sabotage again or worst an outside force that wants to keep me where I am. In a constant struggle for peace. 

I am reaching out to you in the hopes that you can give me guidance and possibly help with what I am feeling and experiencing. I'm reaching out because I don't want things to go back to normal, I don't like this normal anymore, I never have. I just had to play by the rules. I've consumed so much information in the last 4 days, videos, documentaries, journals. If I am reading the signs correctly then this is a calling and the events unfolding in my life really are ways for me to make the journey. 

I don't really know what question I'm asking I just know that I have to put something out there to someone who might help or guide me. 

Thank you so much for your time and advise. ",Ayahuasca,I've felt the Ayahuasca call but I need some direction...
304,"A user named Travis, on another forum, made this post in response to my questions about treating the issues with pyruvate dehydrogenase in ME/CFS directly. It's a tiny bit above my head, but I remember reading Szent-gyorgyi's work ""cancer and the living state"" and him talking about methylgloxal as possibly really important for the formation of life on earth, and having an important role in protein conductivity/the redox aspects of the living state. So now I want to go back and read that and refresh myself, anyway, here's the post:


&gt;I can't think of anything besides thiamine, unless of course you'd find a way to increase the expression of the enzyme. Yet there could be a way to do this: Since pyruvate dehydrogenase is under negative regulation by hypoxia inducible factor-1—via transcribing-for pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase—then taking baicalein and/or lapachol should ultimately act to increase it. These phytochemicals are the two most powerful natural glyoxalase-1 inhibitors (Kᵢ ≈ 5–7 μM), acting to increase methylglyoxal by inhibiting its degradation to lactate. Methylglyoxal is very powerful because it selectively reacts with exposed arginyl side-chains on proteins, irreversibly converting them into hydroimidazolone rings. By reacting with 'hot spot' arginine residues is how methylglyoxal been shown to regulate transcription (Yao, 2007), and the transcription factor HIF-1 is also inactivated in this manner (Bento, 2010). Taking a glyoxalase inhibitor such as baicalein could be expected to: increase intracellular methylglyoxal, decrease intracellular lactate, inhibit 15-lipoxygenase (Deschamps, 2006), inactivate hypoxia inducible factor-1α (Bento, 2010) thereby increasing pyruvate dehydrogenase expression. Methylglyoxal had acquired a pathological reputation because it reacts with extracellular proteins in diabetes, yet this only occurs in states where glucose cannot get into the cell where it belongs. Methylglyoxal also forms inside the cell mainly from carbohydrates, and appears to be the biochemical signal for their metabolic rate. Intracellular methylglyoxal has also acquired reputation for powerfully inhibiting cancer, and very likely the reason why baicalein and lapachol have been so successful at treating it. 

&gt;**Kim, Jung-Whan. ""HIF-1-mediated expression of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase: a metabolic switch required for cellular adaptation to hypoxia."" Cell metabolism (2006)**

&gt;**'Activation of glycolytic genes by HIF-1 is considered critical for metabolic adaptation to hypoxia through increased conversion of glucose to pyruvate and subsequently to lactate. We found that HIF-1 also actively suppresses metabolism through the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) by directly trans-activating the gene encoding pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1). PDK1 inactivates the TCA cycle enzyme, pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), which converts pyruvate to acetyl-CoA. Forced PDK1 expression in hypoxic HIF-1a null cells increases ATP levels, attenuates hypoxic ROS generation, and rescues these cells from hypoxia-induced apoptosis. These studies reveal a hypoxia-induced metabolic switch that shunts glucose metabolites from the mitochondria to glycolysis to maintain ATP production and to prevent toxic ROS production.' ―Jung-Whan
Bento, C. F. ""The chaperone-dependent ubiquitin ligase CHIP targets HIF-1α for degradation in the presence of methylglyoxal."" PloS one (2010)**

&gt;**'Methylglyoxal has recently been shown to modify HIF-1α on arginine residues [22], probably leading to changes in protein conformation. Indeed, immunoprecipitation experiments showed that methylgloxal-modified lysine and arginine residues of HIF-1α, increasing its immunoreactivity against N-carboxymethyl-lysine and Nα-acetyl-Nδ(5-hydro-5-methyl)-4-imidazolone (MG-H1) antibodies, respectively. Thus, we hypothesized that modification by methylgloxal might stimulate proteasome-dependent degradation of HIF-1α, as a result of post-translational modifications.' ―Bento**

&gt;**Yao, Dachun. ""High glucose increases angiopoietin-2 transcription in microvascular endothelial cells through methylglyoxal modification of mSin3A."" Journal of Biological Chemistry (2007)**

&gt;**'Our studies demonstrate for the first time that methylglyoxal causes post-translational modification of a coregulator protein and that this modification affects gene expression. The extent of this modification reflects the net effect of a variety of intracellular processes, including metabolic flux and reactive oxygen formation, and may thus function as a new integrating signal to coordinately regulate distinct patterns of gene expression.' ―Yao""**

305,"I’m still trying to decompress from my ceremony last Sunday so this is going to be a long post. My trip was bad, but also good. When we got to Tomales Bay we set up our sleeping bags in a circle with fifteen strangers. Most of the people were young like us. Before ceremony, we were given rapé, which was really uncomfortable and I don’t think I will do that again. But anyway, around 9 PM we all took our first dose of ayahuasca and waited for it to begin. After forty minutes or so some people began purging, and we were allowed to take as many doses as we wanted. After my second dose I threw up, and I felt amazing after. I closed my eyes and felt a wave of love wash over me. I saw patterns with beautiful colors and I cried tears of joy because I was allowing myself to feel loved for the first time in my life. I accepted the love I felt from the universe and I could feel the weight of all of my limbs being consumed and tingled by this love. Unfortunately this feeling didn’t last long and after my third dose my trip took a turn. The feeling of weight in my limbs turned into an unbearable restlessness and discomfort. I felt like I needed to be held down because I was coming out of my body. I was in hell. I just wanted to fall asleep and for it to be over with. I swore to myself I would never take ayahuasca again. I took a trip to the bathroom and had diarrhea for thirty minutes. During this I felt the pain and agony of my entire life pressed down upon me. I cried and cried and looked myself in the mirror wondering who I was. I wanted nothing more than to be sober and for it all to be over. When I went back to my sleeping bag I saw visions of people dying. It was really insane. Eventually I calmed down and fell asleep around 5 AM and woke up sober around 8. All in all I’m confused about what all of this means. I knew mother aya would tear me apart and it would be an emotional experience, but I don’t understand why my experience would turn from so good to so agonizing and uncomfortable. I thought I would see visions from my childhood or make strides to help my depression and anxiety but I feel like no steps were made and the trip was pointless. What do you guys think?

309,"Probably like a lot of this sub's population, I have a good deal of experience with SSRIs personally, anecdotally, and intellectually. I think they're pretty valuable as a tool for depression and anxiety, and their [neurogenerative potential](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5432636/) is hugely underappreciated.

Personally, I experienced a lot of positive change from them, including in terms of memory and general cognitive function. Anecdotally, I've seen a lot of people come into maturity in part because of antidepressants. The biggest issue, though, seems to be how often people become dependent on them. So, rationally, is there any reason why that dependence is really bad *in all cases*?

It seems to me that there are a couple reasons SSRIs could be negative in the long term:

1. They absolutely suck to come off of if you want to--sometimes to the point of suicide--and a lot of people end up just enjoying their lives more while on them.
2. They have a tendency to ""[poop-out](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4008298/)"" without any real rhyme or reason. 

On the first point, that seems like pretty circular logic. Their incredibly cheap (relatively), especially with insurance, and if people see only positive improvement there doesn't seem to be a need to get off them. Their effectiveness definitely does go down over time, but not so much that people become totally immune... Except in the case of the second point in which case the comedown is much worse than being weaned off.

Obviously, like any drug, the effects are mediated by mindset and they shouldn't be used by every depressed or anxious person. I just think that the, ""you're gonna be stuck on them for life"" is only so feared because people are terrified by the prospect of becoming dependent on any drug (aside, maybe, from caffeine). I don't mean to sound polemical or overconfident, I'm here to hear other perspectives and be corrected if I'm wrong.

I went to a place 2 hours west of Bogota called Mesitas del Colegio

I drank one cup at 00:30 with relative ease and puked maybe 5 minutes later
I then puked again an hour later
I didn't feel anything so I drank another time at 2:00. This time I couldn't manage to scoff down the entire cup due to nausea. I puked again only a minute later.
At 4:40 I decided to try again a third time. It wasn't nearly as easy as the first time but I managed to scoff down the entire cup and using mindful breathing I managed to hold back the vomiting for about 20 minutes

I then went to rest in a hammock and half an hour later I started having some mild closed-eyed visual hallucinations.

Just at they started to appear I fell asleep and woke up at 6:00. Now it's 6:16 while writing.


Each cup of Ayahuasca seemed to be about 40ml in volume.

Out of the ~30 people that participated in the ceremony, 9 people tried yagé for the first time.
Of those 9, I asked 6 of them whether they saw anything. Only one said he did, and that it was a powerful trip. 

It's noteworthy that I didn't have any diarrhea during this night, unlike many others.

322,"I've been looking into trying Ayahuasca for a long time. I've done my research and I know I'm beyond the point of turning back. Essentially I am definitely going to do Ayahuasca for the first time.

However, I'm not very spiritual in the sense: I don't believe in Chakras, the healing power of crystals or astrology. It's fine if you do I'm just not oriented that way. I do however think there are some deeper and more profound levels of insight able to be accessed through some psychedelics.

Where should I go to achieve this?

I feel the greatest alignment with TOTWL, perhaps because it looks like they work pretty professionally yet say all the right things about integration and authentic shamanism.

I would have gone to SpiritQuest at the suggestion of a friend, but their retreats are currently suspended. I have had the following concerns relayed to me:  
\-experience is ""industrial"" or impersonal or inauthentic because of how well established TOTWL is by now  
\-brew is weak  
\-too syncretic, not ""native"" enough  


Can anyone speak to these concerns, particularly the issue of the brew? I am thinking about the 23d deep immersion for the number of ceremonies and the chance to just be in the jungle for a significant period of time without paying much more than a shorter retreat.

That’s a very noticeable difference, and I felt so sick I had to return to 300mg in a couple of months.

329,"Hi everyone, I made a post a while back about two batches of MDMA that I had come across that very reliably, across many test subjects and situations, produce vastly different effects.

For the long story, you can find the original post in my post history. Long story short, I have a sample of brown, safrole smelling MDMA that no matter how much one takes, it doesn't really ""pop off"". Overall a very lackluster experience, not much mydriasis, low energy, anxiety/stress, etc. We've nicknamed it the ""MehDMA"". On the other hand, I have a sample of scentless, clear crystal MDMA that is quite possibly the most powerful MDMA I have ever come across; it produces an absolute explosion of life, euphoria and energy; it puts you in a place that is almost too good to be real; nirvana. Dose for dose the MehDMA cannot compete. Even taking 2 or 3 times the dose, it just isn't the same and weird side effects become noticeable, it makes you just kinda ""fucked up"".

These discrepancies and issues go along with the dialogue happening over at Bluelight about this (\~50 pages of people discussing the exact same phenomenon).

I was able to get both my samples sent to an NMR for analysis, I got the results back today. Sadly they did not provide much information and I'm pressing them for more, but here is what I got:

*""Hi \_\_\_\_,*

*We just received the results of the two MDMA samples back from the lab.*

*1) Brown*

*qNMR: 85% MDMA* 

*MDP2P present in GC-MS analysis*

*2) Colourless*

*qNMR: 91% MDMA*

*No other compounds present*

*This is all the information that they were able to provide.*

*I hope this helps in your search for the answer!""*

There is no way a small 6% difference could impact the effects so drastically, and I cannot find any information on whether significant levels of MDP2P would have any effect either. If anyone has any info on whether MDP2P is active at ANY dose, that info might be helpful.

I’m here in Costa Rica on an Ayahuasca retreat. We are doing 4 nights of medicine and we are on our final night tonight. 

Right before last nights ceremony, I started to experience symptoms of a head cold. During the ceremony, it continued and when the ceremony was over, I had flu-like sweats all night long. I woke up today feeling totally destroyed physically. I should also add that I’ve got stage 4 cancer so I was already in a physically weakened state when I got here. I was strong enough for the trip here - but just barely.

My inclination is to sit this final ceremony out. On one hand, I paid a lot to come here and want the full experience. OTOH, my lymph nodes are swollen, I feel like garbage and the medicine tonight is very powerful. I’m here by myself and even though the staff is superb, I feel called to listen to my own voice and not participate.

I ego checked myself and this isn’t avoidance. I also feel like the goals I had when coming here were met. All my questions were examined. I’ve done some serious emotional work in processing my cancer situation and my death of my husband, which is why I came. There will be two more nights of breathwork that I don’t want to miss.

***You don't have to read this first paragraph.*** 4 days ago I took \~130mg MDMA with my girlfriend in our apartment. It was our second time taking it, the first time being a month ago (I know, I know. I miscalculated like the dumbass I am and I thought 2 months had passed). I took everything that I should've taken, and ate extremely healthily (like tons of fruit and stuff) in the days prior to consumption. It was SO fucking intense. **WAY** more intense than my first time, which was \~120mg. Very sure I had a much more intense experience than my gf too. 10mg difference doesn't account for how much more fucking intense the peak was. I can't even describe it, on my first time (which everyone says is usually the best) I could kind of imagine it being more intense, even though it was already unbelievably intense. This time I couldn't imagine it, and I wouldn't want it more intense if it could be. I was fucking incapacitated with pleasure. Had a nice 2 day afterglow, until I had to go back to work which I hate intensely, making me feel depressed. I'm pretty sure it's work and not the latent M comedown, but I'm not 100% sure.

360,"I was led to ayahuasca through synchronicity over two years ago. 

One of the most important things and lessons that I've received was the importance of family and that there were some aspects of my relationships between my brother and my parents that needed attention. I remember the exact words that I heard being whispered by her presence:

""When you go back home, be there for your family. They need you.""

I did everything that I could and made decisions to the best of my abilities to heal those things. The relationship with my brother is better but my parents are going to get a divorce. 

Mind you it didn't come out of the blue, but the circumstances are quite unexpected. (My mom met someone new which seemed to have made this decision easier for her..) 

They want it to be a clean cut. No fighting, fair share of everything etc.. 

Nevertheless I feel like I failed at what ayahuasca showed me and that I failed as a son. I thought I would come back home and know how to fix my family, but I didn't. I did what I could. ( been open with them about my experience, wrote both of them a long letter, went on a holiday with them to talk about our relationship) 

But it seems like it wasn't enough and I feel shit. I am literally feeling so shit right now. My whole body is tense and my head feels like it's about to explode. 

I feel like I failed aya as well, at least in this aspect... 

I don't know how to go about this situation. I just numbed my feelings and emotions because the whole process that unfolded after ayahuasva was so exhausting that I can't possibly manage this now as well.

I already feel like my waking life is a kind of hell, a kind of purgatory, and when I sleep and have these nightmares it's like experiencing a more intense hell.

So an article was just published today about how Soul Quest Retreats in Florida will not be charged for the death of a man during an ayahuasca ceremony, which is what inspired me to post this.

Ayahuasca related deaths are *incredibly* rare. In my \*opinion\*, a death could potentially indicate neglect or malpractice. Sometimes, participants are not screened thoroughly, prepared properly, or are given dangerous admixture plants like brugmansia (as was the case with Henry Miller). In other instances, participants themselves do not disclose conflicting medication or health issues, in which case, the death was not the center's fault/responsibility.

Regardless, for anyone researching a potential Ayahuasca centers to visit, this information is not readily available. In looking at retreats, I personally would like to know if/how/and why a death occurred at a center before going there. Just as I would like to know about any incidents of sexual assault/violence etc.

There are probably other centers that belong on this list, so if anyone knows of any others, please feel free to comment and I'll add them.

Note\* - I’m NOT trying to scare anyone away from Ayahuasca. There are *hundreds* of other Ayahuasca retreat centers operating without incident, where no one has ever died. Like I stated before, these deaths are incredibly rare. However, I do think transparency is important, and that this information should be readily available to people who are researching places to go.

I have what I think are corn poppies growing in my front garden - they grow like weeds all through where I live (southern New South Wales/ACT).

399,"I had a breakthrough and a disillusionment happen to me at my [first experience](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ayahuasca/comments/772gfc/report_of_first_ever_ayahuasca_experience_and/) in Colombia in October 2017. I met someone there who invited me to come to California for a ceremony at his house by Joshua Tree for $150/$300, depending on if I do once or twice, with a healer from Sedona, Arizona. 

My first experience was very powerful but also made me realize that I never want to go to South America to do it again, only in the States. I got lucky that the retreat gave me a scholarship to do it for only $400 instead of the $1400-$2000 the other people were paying. A lot happened there that made me 'wake up' and not all of it had to do with the medicine itself. I just felt very grateful that I was cared for by the Universe/God and that as long as I am earnest and transparent, all the help/opportunities I need would keep showing up when I am ready for them. 

I'm now at 9 months without alcohol, weed, meat. Now a month without social media and cigarettes too (have only been bumming them for 5 months, no packs since August). I've been working on letting go of underlying issues like shame, fear, doubt, guilt, etc with the help of meditation, prayer, a good support system. I've been working on my agency, gotten more interesting clients, saving a lot of money by not spending on short-term pleasure as much as I used to. I am mending a lot of ties with my family, letting go of all resentments I used to harbor against them. 

I'm mentioning all this because I wonder what benefit ayahuasca could offer at this stage. I'm still open to going to the retreat in mid April but I just want to know more about how ayahuasca has helped people over multiples 'seasons' of use and not just one time.

405,"I'm soon to embark on my first series of ayahuasca ceremonies in Peru. I'm excited and a bit nervous, and I was hoping for some advice about the combination of my own spiritual practice and the ayahuasca journey... I apologise if it comes across as a bit naïve, but as I said it is going to be my first time!

I've been practicing meditation for 6 years. My practice started out by focusing on the breath and evolved to include other concentrations, visualizations and mantras. In the past few years, I have discovered something called Advaita Vedanta, non-dualism, and the practice of Self-enquiry. Self-enquiry was described as one of the two direct paths to Self-realization (the other being complete Self-surrender) by the Indian sage Ramana Maharshi, and my investigations so far find me continuing along this recommended path.

&amp;#x200B;

* Self-enquiry involves: 

1. Noticing arising phenomena
2. Asking ""to WHOM does the \*insert phenomena here\* arise?"" 
3. Witnessing any answer that comes 
4. Usually, a sense of ""I"" responds, and I hold it, and give it attention over other thoughts 
5. While holding it, I ask things like ""Who AM I?"", ""What is this ""I""-thought?"", ""What is the source of this ""I""-thought?"", ""Where did ""I"" come from?"", ""What IS 'I'?"" etc... 

The process is designed to redirect our attention from the passing show of the phenomenal world, the 'appearance' of reality, and back to our real Self, the source of Absolute Reality.

&amp;#x200B;

I have noticed it to be incredible at quieting my mind, and also over the past few months bring about a sense of oneness with the world around me e.g. looking at things and others and realizing they are not other than 'my' Self, amongst other changes. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was curious to know what people thought about the idea of practicing this during ayahuasca? My main intention going into the ceremony is to find out who ""I"" really is, but I have NO idea how compatible this is going to be.

&amp;#x200B;

Of course there is the answer to 'just let go as best you can, and see what happens', but I wondered if anybody had any thoughts on the utilisation of spiritual practices during ceremony :)

I see myself as a very independent individual however and I sort of look forward to the idea of doing this trip all by myself, but perhaps it would be a good idea to have someone close around me right after the experience. At the same time however, I like the idea of taking in the experience and reflect in solitude.

I've got a few speculations on why that might be... any feedback is welcome and wanted.

Mirtazapine acts as an antagonist at 5-HT2a, and an inverse-agonist at 5-HT2c, whilst most SSRIs *increase* the activity of those sites.
Activation of 5-HT2a has been linked to erectile dysfunction and 5-HT2c inhibits the release of Dopamine and Norepinephrine, which are essential for arousal and stimulation.
That, combined with Sertraline's (albiet weak) Dopamaine Reuptake Inhibition may be complimenting Mirtazapine's effects exerted through 5-HT2c.

All this is just from anecdotal experience, but since being on 45mg of Mirtazpaine in Conjunction with the highest dose of Sertaline prescribed (200mg) I've actually seen improvements in my sex drive, stamina, pleasure etc. Which is the opposite of what I had expected given all the testimonies of SSRI induced sexual dysfunction, so this is the best hypotheses I have at the moment.

# In The Declaration of Yarinacocha  Shipibo Healers Organize To Resist Spiritual Extractivism

Last  April, a Canadian ayahuasca tourist  rode a motorbike into the  Amazonian township of Victoria Gracia, sought  out the venerated  81-year-old Shipibo healer Maestra Olivia Arévalo  Lomas, pulled out a  gun and shot her dead. Until that day, Victoria  Gracia had been a calm  if somewhat impoverished settlement a little  distance outside of the  city of Pucallpa. After that day, it became a  traumatized and fearful  corner of Peru, its Shipibo inhabitants  suspicious of everyone and  everything around them.

The  motives and  circumstances of that first murder are molded over with  rumor, gossip  and speculation. But the event became the subject of national and  international news stories when  Maestra Olivia’s murder was avenged  locally and immediately, outside of  the regular state-based channels  which rarely move in to serve local  justice. Police in uniform and in  plain clothes descended on the  community, seeking a few people  allegedly identified in a smartphone  video of the vengeance recorded  and sold by a witness. The state became  heavily invested in the outcome  of the case as the Canadian government  demanded some answers and a  Congressman publicly called the Shipibo  people ‘savages’. NGOs poured  in feeling that they had to do something  but with little idea of what  they needed to do. And there was an  outpouring of sympathy from the  growing international ayahuasca  community – with a few healing centers  also issuing reassuring notes to  their foreign clientele that they  shouldn’t worry, they should keep  coming as they were not in any  danger. Outside Peru, the psychedelic  renaissance movement honored  Maestra Olivia in the comfort of their  western homes. Many who didn’t  even know her wanted to organize an event  in her name, there, here, in  Europe – efforts that for the most part  were blatantly self-serving.

That   initial moment has faded. NGOs have left, foreigners have forgotten,   and ayahuasca tourism is doing what ayahuasca tourism does – come in,   get the medicine, feel unified with the universe, go back. However, as   the state prosecutors issued the first orders of preventive detention,   whilst barring the settlement’s leaders to leave the area, the   indigenous community is left with no choice. It cannot up and leave. It   is there still, trapped, beleaguered, haunted and traumatized by the   events, by the continuing policing of their community, fearful of any   foreigner coming in, awaiting injunctions of the court without any   resources to pay for legal fees, for schooling, for the care of children   and families who have been affected.

The   fallout from the murder of Maestra Arévalo Lomas is emblematic of a   common problem, what we are framing as spiritual extractivism.

It  was with this in mind and in the long shadow cast by these events that  the Consejo Shipibo-Konibo-Xetebo (Coshikox),  the representative body  of the 35,000 strong Shipibo-Konibo-Xetebo  people of the Peruvian  Amazon, called the first ever convention of  practitioners of ancestral  medicine in the city of Yarinacocha at the  end of August. 

Almost   one hundred people showed up. And in what felt like a historic event,   they formed a union of healers. “The work of healing and the struggle   for self-determination… must move forward on the same path,” the union   stated in their final declaration, dubbed the Declaration of   Yarinacocha.

More  often than not, these  two worlds – the political reality and the  spiritual healing – are kept  conveniently hidden from each other. As the  declaration states, the  opportunities opened up by the international  interest in Shipibo  medicine, ayahuasca in particular, has come with  some dangers – and its  popularity has done little so far to address  other larger political  and socio-economic concerns. 

Hundreds   of ayahuasca centers have cropped up around the Amazon. Having spoken   to a wide range of healers and workers, we believe that the majority of   centers, for the most foreign-owned, exploit their employees, do not  pay  them fair salaries and often neglect their health issues. Very few  of  them are concerned with the transmission of knowledge to the younger   generations of Shipibo and the political struggle for territorial   sovereignty. Thousands flock there from abroad for their ceremonies and   speak of expanded consciousness whilst Shipibo communities diminish   physically, as extractivism, contamination, territorial encroachment   take their toll.

In  the case of the  settlement of Victoria Gracia, for example, it has  fallen to Coshikox  and its leader Ronald Suarez Maynas to step in with  meager financial  and legal help. Suarez Maynas himself was dogged for  months after the  events, as he made some very strong statements and  organized a march  against the racist Peruvian Congressman Carlos Tubino  Arias-Schreiber  who came out to call the Shipibo ‘savages’. The police  knocked on  Suarez’ door at night several times. He received multiple  death  threats, which like many other indigenous leaders and  environmental  organizers he has received in the past. Thanks to the way  in which  Coshikox organized politically against state aggression, those  threats  have receded. But every organizer and many communities live with  that  worry day and night. Several community leaders have been  intimidated or  even jailed for trying to stop deforestation, for  fighting against oil  and palm oil interests as these brutally encroach  on the collective  land of indigenous communities. Ayahuasca tourists  don’t bother to  look.

It’s  rarely mentioned, but healers  are migrating out from their villages to  more urban locations  accessible to tourists. Their communities are left  with no health-care  providers. Without a plant-remedy, the only option  becomes a boat ride  to an urban pharmacy. This is just part of the  general out-migration  that is making rainforests even more vulnerable,  weakening the  stewardship of the indigenous communities. Research  demonstrates that  indigenous lands have lower rates of deforestation  than national parks,  nature preserves, and private sanctuaries.  Nevertheless, despite all  of the proof, indigenous peoples as forest  guardians are often left  alone to face their struggles. As Shipibo  activist, Robert Guimaraes  Vasquez put it in a powerful intervention at  the convention: “An  indigenous community that has no healer is doomed to  lose its territory  as well.”

People  come to the Amazon to  heal themselves of the culturally specific  ailments of industrialized,  individualistic societies – from addiction  to depression to sexual,  military and other forms of trauma to eating  disorders and diseases and  illnesses that have found no real cure in the  halls of Western  medicine. Then they get to leave but they leave behind  traces of their  ailments, trails of inequality, frustration, violence,  and sometimes  legal cases. But their consciousness has expanded! They  have  experienced *the way of light*! 

This   is spiritual extractivism. We have to recognize that ayahuasca tourism   is part of a much wider spiritual ecology and political economy, part  of  structures of global inequality, of predatory capitalism, of   EuroAmerican lifestyles and thirst for growth, of the rampant militarism   and corporatism of states that everyday affect the health of the  Amazon  and its peoples.  

Will  the  enlightened and the healed help the overwhelming fight against big   companies eating up the rainforest and destroying the territorial   survival of the very Shipibo communities from whom they are receiving so   much benefit? Will they put their bodies and resources on the line? Or   will they be part of what Franz Fanon, referring to colonialism,  called  the greater organism of violence?

Whenever   something happens to tourists, the news hits the press. There are  legal  and international inquiries. Westerners, often worried about  their own  well-being, and politicians, worried about the reputation of  their  country, call for regulations. But that is misguided.  State-regulated  matters have most frequently worked against indigenous  groups. For  example, the Ministry of Culture, which in some cases does  officially  endorse and recognize practitioners, and the Ministry of  Intercultural  Affairs, in charge of indigenous matters, have both  fought cases *against* the hard-won law of ‘prior consultation’ – *consulta previa* –   which demands that the state and private industry consult with and   obtain the approval of affected communities and settlements for big   projects that affect their lives and territories. Similarly, official   conservation areas, in the name of protecting the environment, have   frequently hampered the lifeways of their indigenous communities and led   to displacement, whilst their so-called allies dream of eco-tourism   ventures. Regulatory organs often benefit the predators. 

The   union of healers and the adopted Declaration of Yarinacocha interrupt   the default call for state regulation and protection of foreigners.   Taking a position against spiritual extractivism and towards Shipibo   self-determination, they flip the coin: how are tourists and their   economic, spiritual and cultural predation to be redirected?

Following  two days of complex, open discussion and rigorous deliberation  in the  Shipibo language – spanning topics from colonialism, tourism,  science,  religion, territorial integrity, fair salaries, exploitation  and abuse,  to intergenerational knowledge transmission, state policies,  the  political and economic condition of Shipibo communities, and  collective  and individual rights – the convention rejected the terms  “shaman” and  “shamanism” as imports that did not capture the historical  specificity  of their work; the Shipibo term *Onanya* was  adopted,  with the qualifier Ancestral Healers (Maestros de Medicina  Ancestral).  Accordingly, the union was named The Shipibo-Konibo-Xetebo  Association  of *Onanyabo*/Ancestral Healers. 

*Associate   Directors of The Shipibo-Konibo-Xetebo Association of   Onanyabo/Ancestral Healers, from left to right: Jheison Romulo Sinuiri   Ochavano, Santos Muñoz Sanchez, Mateo Arevalo, Claudio Sinuiri Lomas,   Elisa Vargas Fernandez (vice-president), Lila Lopez Sanchez, Panshin   Nima Lopez Lopez (president)*                                            The union makes a powerful claim when it  states that in terms of  its history, practice and methodology,  traditional healing and  expertise in medicinal plants has been part of  anti-colonial resistance  and must remain so. In full solidarity with the  Shipibo-Konibo-Xetebo  struggle for sovereignty and the understanding  that traditional healing  is a political practice, we stress our full  support for the  declaration and its principles and urge all foreign  organizations,  visitors and users of Amazonian medicine to heed its  principles, and  ask themselves what they are contributing to that  struggle.

Pre-occupied that the knowledge of plants and practices of the *Onanyas* – Ancestral Healers are being lost and not being transmitted to future generations;

Recognizing   the repercussions of colonialism, state-based and Western education,   and the invasion of industrialization, which has threatened the   ancestral practices and knowledge of Shipibo-Konibo-Xetebo Peoples;

Recognizing   the great expansion of spiritual tourism in Amazonian territories, and   that the international interest comes with opportunities as much as   dangers for the on-going development of ancestral knowledge;

Recognizing the importance of coordination and agreements between *Onanyas*for   confronting the opportunities and for discussing strategies to address   the problems of our communities, which have been dramatically   highlighted by the assassination of Maestra Olivia Arévalo Lomas;

We declare that:

1. Given  their history, practice, and  methodology, Shipibo-Konibo-Xetebo  healing and expertise in medicinal  plants are anti-colonialist forms of  practice and knowledge, able to  resist, transform and reconfigure with  every difficulty and threat. Thus  healers, teachers, practitioners  must remain aware and proud to  cultivate the anti-colonialist nature of  their practices.
2. The work of healing and the struggle towards self-determination are not separable. They must move forward on the same path.

Consequently, we

1. Adopt the term *Onanya* –   Ancestral Healer to replace the common ‘shaman’ and ‘shamanism’,   imported terminologies that do not apply historically to the   particularities of our culture.
2. Suggest that *Onanyas* can  focus  on the training and education of Shipibos youth, especially in  the  communities, so as to counteract cultural appropriation by foreign   apprentices who numerically overshadow local ones since our young   populations do not have comparable economic resources to engage in long   periods of training.
3. Invite *Onanyas*,  practioners,  workers and students (indigenous as well as foreign) to  be conscious of  the politics of Shipibo sovereignty, and to contribute  to the struggle  for cultural, economic and social self-determination.
4. Propose  the establishment of a school,  ‘Escuela Meraya’ (in accordance with  values of this declaration) that  would include education in plant  medicine, politics, and art as well as  in digital, vegetal and  spiritual technologies.
5. Will  investigate the development of a  mechanism by which foreigners taking  advantage of indigenous medicine,  healing and spiritual labour might be  able to contribute to the cultural  and political empowerment of  Shipibo-Konibo-Xetebo Peoples and their  path towards  self-determination; such a mechanism could include, for  example, a tax  or contribution for each ‘*pasajero*’ (foreign patient) to be donated to an organization such as the ‘Escuela Meraya’.
6. Invite *Onanyas*,  to join the  Shipibo-Konibo-Xetebo Association of Onanyas/ Ancestral  Healers so that  they might coordinate in unity and demand their rights  and fair and just  remuneration.",Ayahuasca,Thinking about going to the jungle? – A message from the source

429,"OK so where do I even begin. First off even though I’ve always heard the references to “Mother Ayahuasca” it wasn’t until I took the medicine that it hit me that she is a woman! It’s actually a woman running the show here, this “liquid”, medicine, entity is undeniably female, that was the first thing that blew me away. So on to the show. Early on she introduced me to the Coyote, this Coyote found me when I was young and has always looked after me and protected me, the Coyote plays a huge part in both journeys I took. He’s strong, proud, indifferent, loyal, easily annoyed and a bit of an arsehole. The only thing in all of creation that he has any time for is me.

The first journey was really difficult, there were two other people with me taking the medicine and one of them had a difficult trip and this seemed to have an impact on me. We drank the Ayahuasca twice, once and then another time two hours after the first. It was during the first part that I met the Coyote, when I took the second drink, she (Mother Ayahuasca) actually turned to me and said “we’re not playing now” All throughout the first journey I got a distinct “harsh school teacher” vibe off her

I remember the vomiting, there was a male entity with me at this time while I was throwing up, “I” wasn’t being sick, it was if I was a conduit for something else, I was helping to get rid of something bad. The male entity gently had his hand between my shoulder blades and was encouraging me to expel. There came a point when I couldn’t get anymore out, he told me to lie on my back and I felt my bowels clench, I remember telling him in no uncertain terms that there was no way I was going to shit myself. He told me that there was only a tiny bit more I needed to get out, we seemed to compromise on a fart.

The Mother then took over. As I mentioned there was another person in the room having a really difficult time and that was having an effect on me. The Mother was telling me that if I listened to what she was saying and did what she was telling me to do, it wouldn’t bother me but I fought her. This was a hard time for me and I called on the Coyote to protect me which he fucking did. He jumped into me and told her to back off, I could actually feel her frustration and disappointment. It felt like a son leaving down his Mother. 

The second journey was totally different, but fucking WOW! The Coyote was still with me. I spent a large period with what I can only describe as the DMT Elves, playing with them in their realm. We seemed to feed of each other, making each other laugh “delighting” each other. The happier they were making me the happier I was making them, we seemed to be in a feedback loop of pure joy…….Then I took the second drink! 

BANG!!!! They started to ask me questions, and every time I answered “I don’t know” The questions came quicker, louder I kept screaming “I DON’T KNOW” Laughing “I DON’T KNOW” and I realised the “I don’t know” was actually the answer to the questions. BANG the Universe was ripped apart, they “beamed” pure information into me, I was torn apart by pure intelligence, I had to start throwing up at this stage to let information out so that I could let more information in. It was the most exhilarating, mind blowing experience you could imagine

Then I’m sat down and they’re testing me, they’re placing information in front of me and it’s like “he understands move on”, this goes on for a while.

Then I’m the Coyote in what I can only describe as the Coyote’s realm, it’s a plain, mountain, prairie environment and I’m the only creature in it, I exist in a state of pure being with no thought. Then I think the elves started introducing other creatures, they were these innocent gremlin like things who were annoying me by asking questions, one asked if it was OK to pick up a stick and I was “WTF, you didn’t just ask me permission to pick up a stick what do I fucking care, just pick the thing up” This kept happening, these gremlin things would ask me stuff, I’d get annoyed and the elves thought it was hilarious. I decided to “teach” them and long story short I fucked up

The Mother then took over and I remember her trying to teach me things and the Coyote was all “miss me with that shit” I think (hope) that she was more amused by his disrespect than anything, she was much gentler with me the second time. 

Physically it’s taken a lot out of me, especially the first day. I can’t report any particular insight but it’s early days, I’m almost certain to do it again but one thing I’m convinced of is it’s not for everyone. There was a guy in our group who definitely shouldn’t have been there. This isn’t a panacea for problems, Mother Aya will bitch slap you good, the vibe I got was very much that you are going to get what she thinks you need and not what you think you need 

Also if you’re going to do it, make sure that you’re with people who know what the fuck it is they’re doing, this isn’t something to take with friends on a Friday night, it’s powerful stuff, I’ll post where I did it in ayaretreats and can’t recommend them highly enough

436,"I'm 36 at find myself in a dark place in my life. I am self-employed and have achieved moderate success, but I feel like I am constantly drowning, only barely keeping my head above water. I am married, own a house and have dogs. I fight every day to provide for all of them and I feel like I'm not doing well enough. I have always been smart and creative, but coasting by on those qualities seems to take me no further than here, where real life adult skills like accounting and staying on task for more than 5 minutes are what's needed instead of witty food puns.

I am very depressed and my weapons-grade ADHD does not help things. I find myself at the bottom of a well, too distracted to scrabble out.

It seems that a lot of what troubles me is a very negative way of thinking. I always look for faults first, ignoring the nice things about anything. People take their ideas to me because I'm the usually quick at sussing out why it won't work and then offering some advice from there, but it's always negative first. I suppose I assume that everyone else sees the positive already, so why waste time, let's dig into why this won't work. I once viewed it as a positive skill, but now it seems like a symptom of a darker problem. It seems to cloud a lot of my judgement.

I've read about ayahuasca and DMT and they seem like they could be helpful. I've read about how it can rewire my brain and fix what is wrong in it. I'm interested in a trip to a retreat of some kind to partake in some ceremonies.

I don't drink, smoke, or use drugs and I never have. I don't enjoy the idea of getting high recreationally. I don't like to be out of control of my situation. I understand that that's pretty much the whole point of aya/DMT, though. Maybe as a tool, it would be right for me to give that up in a controlled environment. I approach ayahuasca as a tool to fix my brain, not as a recreational activity. I am not spiritual in the least, I do not believe in it, so I don't bring any of that into it with me either.

I feel like I am at an important cross roads where I want to investigate something like ayahuasca before being prescribed a regimen of mind-numbing anti-depressants.

Am I in the right head space? Will this help me? Could I end up hurting myself?

440,"X/Post from R/BPD

I decided to post this because I often see that BPDs are not recommended candidates for ayahuasca, but it was the best thing I had ever done for myself. 



My Story: I have been in DBT and individual counseling for 10 months now, am 25 years old(F), and prior to DBT, I was not in any formal treatment for my BPD. I have been diagnosed since age 20. I have a history of self-harm, suicidal ideations, my last suicide attempt was in February of this year. I also just went through an extremely traumatic workplace violence incident in August, and my coworker who was also a victim in the incident joined me in the ceremony. I also have a BF who I have been with for 8 years, and we have had a very tumultous relationship in the past and I have been working hard on helping our relationship become stable. I have jealousy issues, reassurance seeking, mood changes, and abandonements issues that were actively hurting the relationship.

The Ceremony: I joined a two-night ceremony for Ayahuasca. I drank the plant medicine at 10pm, and was tripping until around 4 in the morning. The first night, I had to watch myself die over and over again. Hundreds if not thousands of times. I could see my lifeless body in a hospital room. I was seeing it from my loved ones perspective, I was in my BF's body. I was crying and moaning just like he was in February when he had to sit at my bedside after my latest attempt. I could feel how scared he was, how angry he was, I could feel how much he loved me. I was in my parents and siblings bodies, I could feel their deep despair. I could feel just how much my actions would affect them if I chose to impulsively end my life.

I then began to hear voices telling me that the two days of ceremony was over, that I had slipped into a coma. That I was in a hospital and never made it out of the psychosis. I was being told that if I wanted my life, if I wanted to live; I would have to wake myself up immediately. I would jolt up from my sleeping mat and see that I was indeed in ceremony still, and then go back to sleep. Then, I would be sent back into the comatose state and have to fight for my life again. I felt how much I loved being alive, I was forced to fight for this life and hold it dear to me. I had never been so grateful in my life to be alive. Not even after my near-death experience at work in August.

A side-effect of Ayahuasca is that it can make you nauseous, and vomit/have diarrhea. I began vomiting at this point and as I was retching, I saw my friend look back at me with concern and horror. I could feel how much she cared about me and I was overwhelmed with feelings of love. I realized that so many people look out for me daily, and care for me, and love me, even if I don't realize it at the time.

At points throughout the night, I was consumed with ecstasy and Euphoria. I felt a true happiness that I had never felt in my life before. And there was no reason for it. I felt happy to just be.

I understood the love that my boyfriend felt for me. In the weeks after my ceremony, I noticed that I had altogether stopped seeking reassurance. I stopped assuming malice in his actions. I actually loosened the attachment that I had to him. I had FELT his love completely, there was no reason to ask him for it daily.

I no longer have thoughts of suicide or self-harming. I am so grateful to be on this planet. Immediately after waking from the first night's ceremony, the whole world made sense. I was at peace. In the days afterward though, it was a challenge. I was frustrated because I saw that there was so much more work to do. I saw that this shift in perspective would have to be nurtured daily if it were to be truly long-lasting. Ayahuasca showed me the answers, but I had to work on it myself. I had a better appreciation for DBT after Ayahuasca, and realized that so many of the skills were not being given a fair chance by me. I've thrown myself in fully into my treatment and honestly have never felt better.

The process after Ayahuasca is known as ""integration"", integrating what I saw during the ceremony into my real life. It has been a daily struggle. I felt disconnected from many people afterwards. People who I just could not communicate with anymore because I just could not relate. It caused issues in my relationship because I knew my BF could not understand the immense breakthrough that I had. He met my changes with pessimism, commenting, ""we will see how long this lasts."" I also became much less affectionate because I had felt his love, and thought that he could feel mine too, not feeling the need to express it so openly anymore. I communicated with him less because I felt secure in our relationship and did not need to constantly ""check-in"" with him. This was all a huge shock to him, and required some deep conversations, but overall we both felt that the relationship was much healthier this way. I also felt secure in general, and felt my old jealousies melt off of me.

Overall, I feel like many of my negative ruminations have disappeared. I am happy just being. I devote much more time to daily tasks in my home and don't need to distract myself with television or music, because my thoughts are pleasant enough to be alone with. I love myself so much, love my life, and am no longer constantly self-destructing.

Ayahuasca is not for everyone, and it is certainly not a panacea to BPD, but I think it is worth a shot to research on. The US Healthcare System is slowly making a return to using Psychedelics as a treatment to mental illness, for anything from depression to alcohol addiction, to social anxiety for adults with autism. I would highly recommend reading Michael Pollans book, ""How to Change Your Mind"" to get more insight on the topic.

442,"I'm planning a trip to Peru in May next year and whilst this trip includes a variety of different things I wish to experience, Ayahuasca has always been a major reason for heading back out there. I've been to Peru once before where I drunk the brew 8 times, once in Pisac and 7 in Iquitos.

&amp;#x200B;

Whilst these were good experiences, with one being much stronger than the rest, I never had any 'breakthrough' moments. It was more just hallucinations/visions/experiences which I'll never forget, but at the same time, did not go deep.

&amp;#x200B;

I did my best to not hold any expectations, and this became very easy to do once the effects started to deteriorate more and more throughout the ceremonies.

&amp;#x200B;

The guys at the retreat in Iquitos kept telling me that it works in the background and not to worry. Now I don't know if I can even say I understand 1% of what ayahuasca really is but my Western brain tells me, if you ingest something potent, you will have a high chance of experiencing strong effects. Am I really so naive to believe this?

&amp;#x200B;

You can probably tell I have a bit of an underlying frustration here which might be an issue. I don't believe that ayahuasca owes me anything, but I have suspicions that I was given weak brews to reduce the chance of freaking out, or possibly to prolong my stay there, hoping that I would eventually have a strong experience. What made me more suspicious was  that I kept being told that on the 8th ceremony I would reach infinity. Well on the 8th go it just appeared to me that the brew was much stronger, still mild in terms of effects but strong in comparison to the other ceremonies. I hated holding these suspicions but it was either that or just believe that ayahuasca does not affect me, or that I need to work more on myself and with the brew.

&amp;#x200B;

So, if you've made it past my Sunday evening rant, my main concerns with re-booking is looking for retreats that can offer potent brews. Brews that tell you 'oh shit I better strap myself in for this one'. Comparable to when I took around 3g of fresh mushrooms, thought I could wash some dishes before settling in, but had to quickly wrap myself in a blanket and dive in. Even with this modest dose, there was an urgency to focus on the moment.

&amp;#x200B;

I've made a list and have boiled it down to 2 options, Kapitari and DAS:

[http://www.kapitari.org/en/](http://www.kapitari.org/en/)

[http://www.ayahuasca-healing-das.org/](http://www.ayahuasca-healing-das.org/)

&amp;#x200B;

Both have fair prices for retreats with an online presence and the reviews seem pretty good overall, barring a few issues which I'll need to do some further research on before making a decision.

&amp;#x200B;

Can anyone vouch for either of these retreats and the strength of their brews? I will be contacting both with my concerns to see if they can advise at all very soon.

&amp;#x200B;

Also haha, what's the deal with a second cup a few hours in? Can anyone actually hold that stuff down? Once I'm in vomit mode there's no turning back. How about a nice strong cup first time around to get the neurons firing? Then again, I bet I'll have ayahuasca beating my ego down next year, rubbing my face in these words. I can feel it.

449,"Hey guys, I'm looking for some advice. So about a week ago, I met up with some friends that I met while travelling in Peru and did a ceremony with some people in San Francisco village, which is a small Shipibo community up the Ucayali river. This was about my 22nd time drinking the medicine and this experience was truly horrific. Now part of me knows it was the space I was in, and I had just met the shamans so I didn't feel completely safe but went for it anyway because hey it was an adventure. The dose they gave me was way more than I was used to drinking  (I'm super sensitive) but as I drank the glass it was too late to tell them. I came up within 15 minutes and had a huge purge outside the ceremony hut, and it built from there until my reality was just pure suffering and psychotic looped thinking. I got to the point where I stood up and started screaming at the top of my lungs begging for help because I was so confused and started thinking everybody there was trying to kill me and put black magic into me. What ensued was a chaotic mess of delusions me and my friend fell into about the shamans trying to harm us (As far as I can tell this wasn't true, but it did seem that they were not able to hold the space safely for this to unfold.) I felt like everybodys energy in the room was mixing together and I couldn't even define where I began and the others started. 

What happened next was the most traumatic part, it was pure infinite suffering. I felt that I had unlocked some sort of God consciousness and had the realization that the ultimate reality was one of pure torment and suffering and that waking up to it I could never go back and now I knew the truth of existence which at the time was pure pain. This went on for over an hour but felt like infinite lifetimes of this during the experience. To the point where I kept killing myself in the vision only to be placed right back in the suffering, I couldn't die, I could only experience pure hell for the rest of eternity. The guys had to hold me down at one point because I kept trying to run out of the hut. I'm still feeling incredibly raw from this experience and having some dreams and flashbacks of the sensations. Now I'm usually a pretty down to earth rational person, with a mainly Buddhist worldview, but this absolutely tore me to shreds and left me confused and afraid. Most of experiences have had hard parts, but eventually I felt the love and it was for my best. I don't even know how to begin integrating this. 

The community surrounding Ayahuasca always says oh it's part of the process just keep drinking, I don't want to leave off my Ayahuasca journey like this but I really don't know how to move forward.

458,"Hi guys. I wrote about my first experience with Ayahuasca, and I'd love to share this as I think it's beautiful. It's long (about 5 pages) and I'm sure it's filled with mistakes, but I think the main message I want to transmit is there. I won't make a TL;DR as it's the full description that I'm transmitting, and I feel I need this length to transmit what I want. That being said, I hope you guys enjoy it, and discussion is more than welcome.

My first encounter with Saint Daime

I am going to write about my experience with Saint Daime. This was my first time trying it, but I was already familiar with other psychedelics. Even though they all get you in a new headspace (ego-dissolution, seeing at life in a profound way) this was a profoundly religious and enlightening experience, and I have nothing but the deepest thankfulness and respect for Saint Daime and Mother Ayahuasca. If I use capital letters in some words, or titles like Saint or Mother it's just to emphasize my deep respect and appreciation for what I'm talking about, or to put emphasis where I feel it is needed, in words where I want to convey a deeper meaning. Also, I would like to make clear that this is all my personal experience and personal take on things. I think I can say that I am a hippy, and this may sound like a bunch of hippy babbling to someone. I know it would have sounded that way to me at some point in my life. We're all different and entitled to our own opinions, and any reader is welcome to call bullshit on what I'm writing. It's our own choice, and that makes it beautiful. That's one of the many things I learned with this experience.

There's so much I want to say and describe, and I feel somewhat overwhelmed since I don't know where to start, so I guess sticking to a chronological order is a nice, logical approach. Still, I feel some things should be said somewhere else, and I am still in a continuous process of incorporating and processing everything that I've learned. Because of this, I'll take the freedom to interrupt the flow when I feel it pertinent, and sometimes put some of the learning I have done even when it wasn't done in that particular moment. I should also say that the message I want to write here is greater than words, and it's something that must be felt and cannot be dissected by the logical mind. Because of this, language is a very poor tool in transmitting this. Even so, I will do my best effort to do so.

I started going to yoga classes about two months ago. I trained karate for a long time, and learned that discipline and constancy is (not are, both words point to the same bigger thing) the only way that you can be sure to progress and learn deeply, so I have been working on approaching yoga in a disciplined fashion. This has been one of the best decisions in my life. It has brought me to a space of mindfulness and consciousness, from which all that is good comes. I was told to set an intention for the ceremony, and think about what I wanted to work about myself. It's hard to pinpoint exactly, but I decided I want to find my path, and find a way to cultivate myself. My intention is that of self-growth and learning. I greatly lower my alcohol consumption one week before, and completely stay of it and weed three days prior. On the day of the ceremony, I make sure to only eat fruits and vegetables. I think this setting of an intent, approaching with an open mind and heart and a healthy mindset are what kept me from vomiting during my experience: when consuming Mother Ayahuasca she first cleans and purges the body prior to working on our inner selves, and approaching the ceremony with a clean body and mind meant I did not have to go through this cleansing process. Yet at some points I did feel some nausea, and I could feel how this was due to my prior unhealthy habits (the body doesn't get clean in just three days). No vomit came, but some burps did, and each one carried away bad energy that had to be cleansed from me. Had I vomited, I'm sure it would have been deeply cleansing.

Returning to the subject at hand, I was invited to an Ayahuasca retreat. Having experienced and learned many things from other psychedelics, I happily accepted this opportunity when my yoga teachers told me about it, and went to the ceremony. It was on the way there that I found out the difference between Saint Daime and Mother Ayahuasca. Mother Ayahuasca is the beverage (or is in the beverage, however you prefer to conceive it), while Saint Daime is how it's called when performing this ceremony that I'll describe in the next paragraphs. On the way there my teacher told me two things that resonated a lot with this experience. First, he told me the difference between Saint Daime and Mother Ayahuasca was that Saint Daime is a group experience: we help each other out while we're there, helping anyone who gets lost or overwhelmed while we're all contributing to a positive energy flow, while Mother Ayahuasca is ""just"" the brew and can be consumed without this ceremony. The second thing he told me was that I should always take it when it's offered to me, and I'll go deeper into why this was so important for me during my story.

Once we got to the place, we are told that throughout the ceremony we should try to all stay seated and contribute to the chanting, as this is a main focus point. Yet, if the experience gets too overwhelming at some point, everyone's welcome to lie down for some time, but after some moments they're invited back to their chair, to continue with the chanting. Seating should be with open arms and legs, but no one is going to scold a person who doesn't follow this. Deeply profound lyrics about Love, Acceptance, and Healing are sung all the time, as we're invoking ""the divine"". This experience taught me that the divine resides in all of us, it is that core which makes us love, respect, be thankful, creative, courageous, joyful and basically everything that life is worth living for. Maybe the word divine is awkward for someone who is not religious (as I feel it would have been for me before this experience), but I cannot think of a better word to describe this holy spark that resides within us. It has always been in all of us, and it's at our core, yet it is our decision if we want to open our eyes to it and shine, or remain asleep in a state of blind numbness. As a non-religious person, the lyrics about Jesus Christ and Virgin Mary didn't resonate with me at first, it was until I was deeper in the experience that I started appreciating the whole symbolism that these figures carry, and realized that even if I don't believe in those ""idols"" in a literal way, I can just think them as analogies for talking about That that is Greater than Us, from which we are all made and are a part of. The Om, God, Buddha, Allah, the Cosmos, Nature, you may call It what you want, but everything we see and everything that exists is just a manifestation of this Holy Being, another frequency on which the Light is vibrating. We are all a different manifestation of this Holy Light, and it is infinite, profound and beautiful. The whole point of the chanting is invoking this Love, to bask in it and use it as a healing energy for our souls. Hence we all dress in white for the occasion: we are beings of Light, and we're going to a place of Light to shine and resonate with the energy of Love.  

Before starting the chanting, we are all invited to have one cup of Saint Daime: we proceed in an orderly fashion and it is given to us by a member of the Church of Saint Daime, it's a very similar experience to receiving a sacramental bread (the body of Christ in a Catholic ceremony). The flavour is earthy and strong, yet I did not find it unpleasant. I go back to my chair, and after everyone's done the Chanting begins. Some prayers of Love and Peace are said, and the Healing Spirits are invoked. Before continuing, I think I should make something clear: these presences are already inside of us, and if you don't like the wording ""presence, spirit"" or any other esoteric vocabulary just think of it as the intent and the feelings we have, for they point to the same, deeper meaning. Returning to the ceremony, as the Chanting goes on an hour passes and I feel nothing. I'm scared that it might not hit me: some people have vomited and are already in a full-on battle with their inner selves. As time passes, I slowly start feeling Mother Ayahuasca in me: my thoughts are clear, deeply introspective and profound. I follow the hypnotic energy current made by the chanting while contributing to it: we are all a part of this current, and we must all contribute to it and treat it with the utmost respect, as it is something deeply sacred. As I continue to feel how I'm smoothly ascending into this spiritual plane, I start having mild visuals of geometric patterns. I feel a bad reptile presence near me, but it quickly vanishes as I focus my energy on healing. Still, the trip is not that intense yet. I also realize how the reptile analogy can be used for that low, instinctive part within ourselves that only wants immediate pleasure, a low form of life that opposes our higher, inner selves. After this thought, I make a note to myself to read the Bible sometime with an open mind for analogies and seek the wisdom in it.

There's a pause in the Chanting. The Shaman (who is leading the ceremony) reminds us that we're not stopping and this is not an intermission, so we should not get lost within ourselves in the meantime: the work is still ongoing, and this is just something that is a part of the ceremony. They go out to have some Rapé (Rapé is tobacco that is blown up your nose, and it's claimed to have great cleansing properties) with anyone who wants some (I don't want anything up my nose so I decline), and after coming back, the second round of Saint Daime is distributed and the Chanting resumes. Then, as I feel how It Enters in Me (or my inner self Awakens, or whatever you prefer to call it), I hear the message ""SMILE"" as a precursor to this trip that is coming from a deep, ancient and wise part inside of me. I have always been a very cheerful person, and have been known to smile a lot. Yet this ""SMILE"" message was deeper at the same time: it was a message of acceptance of what's to come, of acceptance of Reality as it is, and with this acceptance comes an elation, a basking in Reality that can only exist when we accept It as it is.

As I am ascending, the feelings get overwhelming and I need to lie down for a couple of seconds. Yet after lying down I realize that the work I am doing, and the work I need to do on myself will be more effective if I continue Chanting and remain in the Love current. The Chanting is never stopping, and each new lyric is more beautiful than the last one, showing a deeper meaning that I can get thanks to Understanding and Accepting the last message. Yet all of these lessons come from the same place, and in the end are the same thing: Love, Peace, Acceptance. Only by Understanding something can we feel a true love. Yet I am not talking about an analytical understanding, as one might understand a mathematical theorem or the solution to a logical puzzle. This Understanding comes from deep within, from our inner Buddha, our divine spark, and True Love is just recognizing this same Buddha nature somewhere else. It's everywhere. Love is everywhere, and it's up to us if we decide to embrace it and spread it, or maintain our eyes closed and surrender to lower pleasures, to follow the snake. Our enemy is inside of us, and we are battling it all the time. Feeling weakness is normal, but in our Divine Self we can find the strength to overcome it. Our Divine Self IS this strength to overcome it, and we can choose if we want an Awakened, strong inner self, or leave it dormant and useless. It's our choice if we want to wake up from this dream and spread Light and Be Light, or if we continue to sleepwalk through a world of illusions, fake accomplishments, and pointless pleasures. And even after waking up, we must always continue to work not to let it go back to sleep, we must continually nourish our Inner Fire so that we have the strength to burn and Shine Light. The enemy is always inside of us, it's our lower self, the part that basks on all the capital sins that religion has taught us. And at that moment I saw how it has won many battles in me, way too many. I decide this won't do anymore, and my weapons for fighting it are Discipline, Love, and Acceptance. We are beings of Light, and we have been blessed with this Light. By acknowledging it we are also taking the heavy responsibility to act by it. Yet one of my realizations was that by seeking joy in defeating our inner enemy, by feeling joy in being disciplined and doing what must be done, there will be no effort done in accepting this responsibility, as the acceptance and the acting in it bring Joy. So by seeking Joy in following my discipline and making myself greater, I have changed what was a negative energy into a new challenge. What a beautiful message! If this is not deeply moving, I don't know what it is.

The Chanting stops, and we are called for a third cup of Saint Daime. I'm feeling somewhat overwhelmed by the experience, and I am afraid to take the third cup. Yet some words I read a week ago resonate within me. ""Courage comes after defeating fear, not before"", and I decide to get up, take the third cup and accept whatever comes; I'm in the best place I could be to explore that which scares me, and if there was ever a moment to say no to my fears it was right then. From that, I learned I should never give in to my fears, and by acting with Courage, by trusting my divine nature I can overcome anything. I am a being of power, as we all are, and in a spiritual way everything is within my reach: this is the alchemy of old, ""transmuting lead into gold"", transmuting inner demons and bad energies into Courage and Divine Light. By shining this Light everything that is dark disappears and turns into more Light, for darkness is just the lack of Light, but Light exists by itself. Later, after the ceremony, as I talked with a friend I met there who was also trying Mother Ayahuasca for the first time, he told me he didn't dare to go for the third cup and that I was more courageous than him. Since then, it has slowly been dawning to me that I successfully transmuted my fear into Courage, and realized this is a deep practice I should incorporate in my everyday life. It's a practice of Light.

The Chanting continues, and after taking that third cup I am in Nirvana: I have faced my fears, and this kind of deep action can only cause an empowerment to my inner Buddha. The ceremony continues, and the lyrics are even more profound than before. At least for me, since I am Understanding the message more and more, and so I am able to appreciate them more fully, with an open heart. I feel the Love for I am Love, and I rejoice in this. I feel a deep Love towards Life. The healing continues, and my inner self gets more and more empowered as I feed it more Love, and this creates a most beautiful self-feeding loop. At some point, I asked one of the church members if I could record this: I am thinking I MUST show it to my friends. He tells me to just enjoy it (and I'm asked to get back into chanting as my talking disrupts it, I'm deeply ashamed since I feel disrespectful and quickly fall back into place), and I Understand that it would have been an empty act: what I want to show them and transmit to them is this message of Love that I'm feeling, and the recording would just serve as a vanity to show around, a mere curiosity. 

Sometimes, when a song ends, the Shaman sings again the last lines, imbuing the words with all the meaning that language cannot carry, showing us this deep way of feeling like a parent would teach their children. Showing us how we have been singing robotically, and that we must Feel and Embrace. I'm not overselling it when I say that it's been the among the most beautiful things that I have heard in my life.

After what could have been the glimpse of an eye, or all eternity (users of psychedelic drugs know how time perception is weirdly affected), the ceremony ends, and the room erupts in applause. Everyone is basking in Joy, and slowly the room breaks up into people talking with people about the experience, all the while everyone takes out food for sharing. This is where I had the enormous luck and honour of talking with Wayne, one of the senior members of the Church.

While talking with Wayne, there are three big teachings that I want to write about here (although he gave me more than that, I just grabbed the things I was ready to learn). 

\- The first teaching was the beauty of sharing. And of course, as with all teachings of Love, it deeply resonates with what I have already felt in my everyday life, it's something that deep inside of me I already knew but just never took the time to acknowledge. Buddha said ""Thousands of candles can be lit from a single candle, and the light of that candle will not be shortened. Happiness never decreases from being shared"". Anyone who has experienced a true friendship, or relationship, or partnership, knows the Joy that comes from sharing Joy, and the only word I can think for that right now is divine.

\- The second teaching was that of teamwork for creation. He taught me how the most beautiful things we can do in our life are not just for oneself, and by creating as a collective we can achieve higher purposes. Being able to create as a collective is what has made human beings what we are now, for all of humankind is not built on a single person's work.

\- The third teaching resonated deeply with me, and it's something that he told me after I spoke about being humble. ""It's ok to be humble, but Acknowledge your Greatness"". I must learn to trust myself, for if I don't Acknowledge myself how can I Acknowledge anything else? Before I'm ready to Love fully, I must first find this Love inside of me.

After this, and throughout our conversation, we hugged each other deeply and he told me he Loves me, his eyes staring directly at my Soul. I feel nothing but the utmost Respect, Thankfulness, and Love for such a profound, beautiful and elevated human being. Wayne, my Brother, my Teacher, I Love you.

There are a few loose ends that I would like to tie up, and things that I'd still like to write but feel didn't fit in the ceremony's description. I will address all of this in the next paragraphs. Because of this, they might feel somewhat disjoint, but it's things that I feel I should say and didn't feel they belonged in the ceremony. I think most of the things immediatley concerning the ceremony have been said. Even though I have already said it, I would like to remind again that all of what I'm writing is but a pale shadow, a logical description of Something that goes beyond logic. We like to think we know everything, and humanity is living in a time where we are deeply disconnected from our inner selves. Technology and science have given us a fake sense of power, and although I think they're great tools and consider myself a man of Science, we should never forget that logical knowledge can be an illusion for our ego to think ""we get it"", and ""we're over all of that"", if we don't take it with the same pinch of salt Science shows us to put in everything. Our ego is but an illusion to make us think we're separate from everything, when in reality we're all different manifestations of the same It. Think about the vastness of the Cosmos, think about how wonderful it is that we exist, and how even the most technical and advanced scientific knowledge is but the result of a couple thousand years of development in an infinite universe. We think we're very smart and have understood everything, but it is only when we Accept and Understand that Reality is infinite and any logical description will fall short on explaining it that we can ""wake up from the Matrix"", awaken our inner selves and live our lives to their fullest. It is only by accepting that we can rejoice in knowing there is an Infinity out there, of which we are a manifestation, and it is all there for us to Explore, Enjoy and Love, and infinite space where we can Create and Shine.

I have to admit that I have been abusing weed lately. And I don't call abusing it smoking it often, but it's more on the way I was using it. I think there are three ways by which Marihuana can be used. The first one is that of exploration of the inner self, which I believe is a laudable goal and a great use for this great herb. The second kind of use can be for socialization and connecting, which I think is another laudable usage. Both of these usages just use Marihuana as a catalyst to bring out our inner divine selves. The third kind of use, which is where my abuse came from, is out of boredom. When smoked as an escape, it's not connecting us to our inner, divine selves. I think the same can be said about alcohol and any other drug that just stimulates us and gives us instant pleasure. (Even though alcohol can also be used to connect and relax, and this is how I plan on using it from now on). Even though it's only been two days since the ceremony, I feel deep inside of me a different view on this, and I know I will not consume it that way again. I find it sad, cynical and a reflection of our society's standards that such a wonderful and powerful medicine has been banned as illegal, while its consumption has actually been proven over and over again to heal us deep within, story after story of alcoholism and addiction defeated with the help of Mother Ayahuasca.

When my yoga teacher told me about this experience, she told me I would feel like a warrior afterward. Now I get it. I have opened my eyes, and I feel all the willpower in the world to face life and spread Light. I am a warrior of Light, as we are all beings of Light, and I have embraced this nature in me. I know it will not always be easy, and right now my Soul has just been fed and feels shining very brightly. I ask that I have the Strength to always face what comes my way, and I know that as long as I face it with an open mind and an open heart everything will be ok. I feel this entire ceremony can be a great tool for empowerment: it's not going to fix all my problems, for there is no magical remedy for that. And yet it has shown me a way to fix all my problems, and whatever might come, for when I accept what comes I can find an answer, I know it's in my inner Buddha.

If there's one message I want to leave in these words is that Life is beautiful. We have been given everything, and the Beauty partly resides in that we have a free choice on what to do with this. We can choose to move through life in an Awakened state, helping others and spreading Love and good vibes, or we can choose to follow the immediate pleasures. I'm not saying my choice is better, but once you feel what it's like to have your heart open and live like that, it makes no sense for me to go back to a sleeping state. Once you get in a head space where you understand where religions come from and see the deep Beauty of the Everything, you understand why religions are such a big deal. This is the message I want to leave in these words, and it's here for the grabbing of anyone who wants to grab it. ""The secret is there's no secret"", so the only way to feel Love and connect with our inner selves is by doing that work, and fighting to do the right thing, always. This is the discipline, and by finding Joy in it we create the most beautiful cycle. The destination is not important, we will all end up dead anyway. It's not the Where but the How that matters, and this is how I am now choosing to live my life. I am choosing not to live in the past or in the future, but enjoy the Present and be present, for it's only in the Present that our Divine Selves reside.

I am that Fire which cannot be extinguished, I am made of Light and must make my best effort to shine my Light in any darkness that I encounter in my path through life. Fire is Life, and I am Life. It's a manifestation of that that is changing, giving off energy to its surroundings. My life will end at some point, as all lives must, but my Fire will never be extinguished. I am Fire made flesh. Fire is ever-changing, as is Life, and that's why divinity lives in the Present. What a beautiful coincidence to have such a profound name, even though my parents named me for different reasons, I am deeply thankful for this name and to them, for all they have done. I know it has always been to the best of their knowledge, out of Love, and even though I don't agree with many things they have done and how they look at life, I am deeply thankful and incredibly lucky to be Loved in such a devoted way.

465,"Hi guys,
I've been working with good quality acid for a year and a half, once a month, and the last few drops have been way too high/pure, so I'm dialing back a bit. (whoever advised me that it's best to take as much as you have at once probably never had scary good quality imo) 

anyhow, the reason why I started acid in the first place is that I felt I could get a glimpse of what aya work done properly might feel like, especially with all the unprepared/already-broken people's horror stories you hear.

I'm now wondering if someone experienced with both medicines could be kind enough to try and give a comparison of what it feels like at decently serious dosage.

Right now I'm assuming that what I get from acid might be pretty similar to what an aya trip feels like, but it's speculation.
Acid is being very generous to me and I've already been far and wide (not boasting, just stating, based on what I hear about other people's acid trips) 

so I would love to hear from experienced psychonauts, but please, if you went at these with inresolved traumas or anxiety issues,  I'm not sure I'll be able to relate,
so if possible, only emotionally stable people's stories. By emotionally stable I mean no offense, just that many people have triggers, and that makes their experiences non-relatable. 

so I guess I'm looking for people who have dealt with their past issues and traumas before or through medicines.

472,"Hey all. I've wanted to try aya for well over a year but have not had the opportunity to be in a group, so I stayed away. I'll be interviewing with the people organizing the sessions tomorrow, and thought I would tell y'all some stuff first. 

I know these people typically don't like people who are suicidal. The thing is that I'm absolutely desperate to remember a childhood of abuse, but at the same time, so incredibly resistant. I don't mean just to myself, but everything. I don't like life in general. The whole experience is a trigger for me. The whole thing makes me sick. I'm a self destructive person doing my best just to not drink alcohol right now. I'm so angry and sad and shut down. Best I can describe is that I'm that abused dog cowering in the corner of its pen, exhausted by hypervigilance. I've had a dissociative disorder 98 percent of my lifetime. I'm a sexual abuse and incest survivor. I just feel physically sick all the time.

I did mushrooms about 3 weeks ago alone in the woods in an effort to get in touch. It was a heavy dose. One of my questions is whether or not this is the same as aya. On the come up there was complete dissociation and sickness. It's like my mind wants to get away from my feelings so badly. I want to get away from myself and it seems endlessly pathetic and existentially and physically and emotionally taxing to the point that sometimes I believe my only hope is to be euthanized. And this should bring tears to my eyes because it really is that tragic. But I refuse to feel or cry. I only feel hate and disgust and fear towards myself and never a window to feel anything else. I feel broken in every way.

I cried and as I sobbed I did see a diety in a head dress staring at me. She was unemotional and terribly objective. I cried and laid on the ground and shook and puked and got back up and sort of just paced around feeling incredibly lost, my body was alien to the point that it was nothing short of terrifying. I always feel like this. I believe I just hide it from myself. My feelings are always trying to get through, but I don't let them. Then I just felt sort of attacked by all my thoughts and threw up some more and went walking. It felt good or more right to throw myself down and cry than it did to just walk trying to run away from everything. It's like I was in a temple of eyes and they were all watching me. Not helping, just watching.

Anyone else experience this?

473,"For the past few years I was using regular therapeutic doses of methylphenidate (Concerta) 36mgs and Vyvanse 30mgs (not combined together) and high doses of caffeine (400mgs daily), ephedrine, and pre-workout 3-4x a week. 

I've basically been highly stimulated for 2-3 years. 

One day I took some pre-workout and ran a 5K at the gym and pushed myself really hard for a personal best time - followed by a very intense session in the sauna for 1-2 hours (would not suggest this). 

Afterwards I had a strong sense of paresthesia in the right side of my head/brain and a very strong sense of anxiety. In the following weeks I had 4 or 5 full blown panic attacks and a high baseline anxious state. This was 3 months ago.  

I have stopped the stimulants. But this anxiety has stayed with me for 3 months now. It is progressively getting better, but I'm surprised given that it has been 3 full months - and the sense of paresthesia is still somewhat there.

First time user. Had a vision of my own birth being that of an alien. Some entities told me I would never belong with humans. I pleaded it not be true, but they told me it’s like that. I came to the ceremony with the intention that I wanted to become closer to people. But I feel like it worked in the opposite way, and I’m honestly so fucking pissed and bitter about the whole experience since it’s resulted in some real nasty anxiety and general fear that’s still with me and won’t  let go of its grip. I feel very upset and scared to my bones.

I’m a very “brainy” guy and I dont believe that “mother Aya always shows you what you need to see”. I didn’t need to see that. I’ve been dealing quite successfully with my anxiety for the past three years. 

I just feel so stupid, wish I couldn have it made undone. And beneath the bitterness, there is a guy that would really like some help. I feel like I kinda ruined my life, and that it’s all my fault.

If anyone has any tips and help, and please in a normal/non-spiritual lingo, I seriously can’t stand the chakra bs. Sorry if I’m sounding very pessimistic, I just feel generally provoked by all the talk around this plant being so magical and healing because i sure don’t feel healed.

Watch this promo video about our new surveys and then **please do come back and read on**…

[https://vimeo.com/265532309](https://vimeo.com/265532309)

With these **three** new surveys, the Imperial team hopes to advance our understanding of the effects of psychedelics, and so help maximise safety, awareness, and wellness.

All surveys are anonymous, reaching out to people who intend to take a psychedelic drug in the near future, but each has a different focus:

**1.** **Global Psychedelic Survey:** Are you planning a psychedelic experience using a classical psychedelic \(e.g. LSD, ayahuasca, psilocybin\) or related drug \(e.g. Iboga/Ibogaine, salvia or Ketamine\) in any kind of setting **apart from an organized retreat or ceremony**? Then Imperial’s Global Psychedelic Survey is your survey! For more information and to sign up, visit [https://global.psychedelicsurvey.com](https://global.psychedelicsurvey.com/)

**2. Microdosing Survey:** Are you planning to begin a course of microdosing soon, i.e. taking very small amounts of a psychedelic over a given period of time e.g. 4 weeks? Then check out Imperial’s microdosing survey [https://microdosingsurvey.com](https://nam02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%253A%252F%252Fmicrodosingsurvey.com&amp;data=02%257C01%257C%257Cb6aa6b9ba2254a2c04ce08d5a5c7c79d%257C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%257C1%257C0%257C636597199821400957&amp;sdata=ZcDf6Cn9vQVrCgbWSbzM7U5H1l9N6YHOok2Av2RMUBw%253D&amp;reserved=0).

**3. Ceremony Survey:** Are you planning on participating in an organized psychedelic ceremony or psychedelic drug retreat sometime soon? If so, please consider signing up for the Psychedelic Ceremony Study, which will collect data on the psychological effects of psychedelic use in these unique settings. For more information and to sign up, visit [https://ceremonystudy.com](https://ceremonystudy.com/)

491,"For instance, say someone were to pursue ayahuasca without demonstrating any commitment to healing through any other means, yet seeks to “keep up” with “spiritual trends.”  How might their experience go?

Most often in this community, I come across people who truly want to heal trauma and change their circumstances.  Sure, some people are curious and may truly be content with their lives (which is awesome) and may purely want to expand their perspective through the medicine. 

I wonder, though, if anyone here has or knows somebody who has drank ayahuasca for seemingly “superficial” reasons, and how their experience went?  In no way am I trying to be judgmental by using the term “superficial” and perhaps that’s too strong of a word. I’m referring to reasons that aren’t associated with healing, growth, genuine curiosity, etc.  I hope this makes sense.

493,"Just wanted to leave this note here as I would have liked to have read it a couple of years ago when I started my psychedelic journey.

I have used some powerful drugs for self-improvement over the past few years. I've used ayahuasca (ceremony setting), LSD, 4-ACO-DMT, MDMA, Ketamine, 2CB. They certainly taught me valuable lessons, which I integrated into my life. I wouldn't have been where I am now without them.

But I also made the mistake of thinking this exploration was a substitute for therapy. Only now, since I've started working with a great (open minded) therapist, am I getting to the core of my issues. Each session, it's like the carpet has been pulled from underneath my feet. It is almost as intense as a light trip, and the lessons learned are more powerful, because it's easier to make sense of them in the real world.

It's a common thing that's said, but I'll say it again; a good therapist is a worthwhile investment. Especially if you've had a turbulent past, then it's a no-brainer. But even if you don't think there's all that much wrong with you, if you're someone who wants to get the most out of life and don't want to wake up at 60 thinking ""what on earth happened to all those hopes and dreams I had"", the right therapist might be able to help you get to where you want to be.",Ayahuasca,"Psychedelics are great for healing, but don't forget therapy"
494,"According to the research I've heard Fluoxetine (prozac) is supposed to aid with depression through increasing neurogenesis.   


I'm not asking for medical advice here, I'm just curious about the impact it might have on this.   


I used to work as a designer but I'm learning code right now. I got really depressed when I first stopped working as a designer and so I starting taking prozac. It sorta worked, and sorta didn't. I noticed that if I take it in the morning it dulls my focus so I only take it at night. Taking it at night gives me some crazy dreams, which is kind of nice because I haven't remembered my dreams much since I was a kid. But also with taking it came weight gain and I've noticed that when I take it earlier in the evening sometimes I end up feeling really sad. I don't know if I'm actually ""less depressed"" than I was two years ago. When I first started taking it, it felt like it might be helping, but it wasn't like the sun came out shining. And in some ways I'm not sure if taking prozac could do that because honestly my situation has been pretty rough the last couple of years.   


That said, if it increases neurogenesis then it seems like it would be helpful for learning and right now I'm basically drinking from a firehouse learning  a bunch of stuff. I worry that if I stop taking the prozac maybe learning will be harder, or that I'll lose some edge that it's giving me to take in new information.   


Obviously I'm going to talk to my therapist about this too etc, and I'm not asking for medical advice, but I am curious if anyone can chime in on whether or not neurogenesis is actually linked to increase learning aptitude etc.

I don’t usually read Vice articles, precisely because I find the level of bias frustrating. But this one in particular stood out as ludicrously irresponsible even for Vice. The take home of the article is that women with severe morning sickness are increasingly smoking cannabis to alleviate their symptoms due to concerns over Ondansetron’s safety during pregnancy. 

A cursory review of the literature yielded a 2011 BMJ review stating the evidence for Ondansetron causing birth defects was low quality (linked below) and recommended its use for treating hyperemesis gravidarum.
Additionally, I have read pretty extensively on peri-natal THC use and the results seem to suggest in a pretty compelling manner that THC is not good for the developing brain (review and animal model study linked).

I tend to be pretty indifferent to individual substance use regardless of its potential effects on one’s own body. But this level of misrepresentation of the facts seems actively malicious and on-par with an anti-vaxxer blog.
This is mostly just me seeking validation for my rant but I’m also curious how everyone else feels about this. It seems like people are inventing increasingly ridiculous applications for “medical marijuana” as public opinion shifts in its favor and I think it’s frustrating when people choose to blind themselves to the evidence that doesn’t support their idealistic view of Cannabis as a “miracle drug”.

499,"2 weeks back from my first ayauhasca experience.  I drank 3 times and this is my report of the last time drinking and by far the hardest. I went for healing and I got it but it was harder than I ever could have imagined. That being said I am very happy I did it and the integration is going well. So here is the report I wrote the day after the hardest night of my life.

I was cleansed by the shaman,  He told me that I should beware of my anger that anger causes me to lash out and I really hurt people. This didn't make sense to me at first because I dont get angry very easily but when I thought about it more that it exactly the reason why it gets out of conrol, what I deny I cant control. He told me that i think too much that i need to think less and feel more. He then wiped my body with a handkerchief and gave it to me along with the candle. I was instructed to bury these items after the candle burned out as a representation of  burying my past and moving on. Then he blessed my 3 tablespoons and I drank the awful tasting medicine. It didn't come on strong like the other times, it was gentle and I fell into a blissful sleep. The next thing I knew I was woken up and told the shaman wanted me to drink another cup if I could so I did. The taste was far worse than it was before and I regretted taking it almost immediately. Before long I started looping and losing my mind. I would burp the nastiest ayahuasca burp over and over again. I didn't understand what was happening all I knew was that it was horrid and I wanted it to end. Things got worse from there. I cant clearly remember all the different loops I was in but i will try to describe a few. One was an understanding that something terrifyingly horrible happened to me when I was learning to become a person as a child. It wasn't clear what the thing was but it was so scary. The sense that I wasn't safe and there was something wrong with me. From there things only got worse. Life and myself stopped making sense I was compelled to say nonsense phrases over and over. Then it got really really bad, I came to the realization that I had way too much and I was dying, life as i knew it was over it was the most scary thing that I have ever experienced and the worst part was that it just looped endlessly, I would realize the horror for the first time over and over again and each time along with realizing the horror was the knowing that same moment had already happened soooo many times and was going to continue to happen, I was screaming at the top of my lungs sure that I would end up moved at best, in the psych ward or dead at worst. So after an endless number of times of that my stomach went completely rotten and I started retching over and over again. It the purge would not come. a facilitator reached out to hand me a paper towel and I grabbed his arm and pressed my teeth firmly onto his arm like a scared animal, I have to idea why that happened but thank god I didn't hurt him.   I eventually laid back down and the horror continued. I was not just in a thought loop but the outside world was looping as well. Every time I opened my eyes the world would reset. I saw the same looks from the people next to me and the shaman was walking past me over and over every time i opened my eyes he would walk by again, it was as if he was guarding me protecting me from danger. At that point I lost any knowledge of my old life it was the hell of my existence over and over for eternity and I regretted ever coming here in that moment, it was the perpetual realization of the horror of the moment repeated endlessly. Eventually the looping did stop and I was back to general discomfort and unease. I was honestly surprised I was still in the tent and I was even more surprised to learn that i was quiet most of the night because i knew for a fact that i was screaming, retching, burping and uttering nonsense words and tearing at my flesh as I writhed around in pain for endless hours. Turns out most of it happened only in my head even though it seemed absolutely real and I can remember it vividly now. I'm not sure I know what it means but my best guess is that the medicine was showing me the true extent of my suffering and that feeling that pain so raw was what I needed to do to get past it and learn that it doesn't belong to me and I can let it go. It was like a death and ressurection, the death was so painful but necessary for the new me, the true me to emerge on the other side. If its not of the light it doesn't belong to me and I will let it go.

I want to add that this was a very strong brew, I felt strong effects, almost overwhelmingly strong from 2 tablespoons the first night. This experience happened off 5 tablespoons so maybe a little much but I'm glad it happened, I am changing my life for the better already. I dont want to scare people away from trying ayauhasca but know that it can be very challenging but positive in the end I believe for the vast majority of people. Also I was at an amazing place with great facilitators who were vital to me processing this experience In a positive way. ",Ayahuasca,Post ceremony report. A challenging trip.

After a month or so I finally feel ""grounded"" and fully ""integrated"" again. The best way I can describe my experience is that following my first changa journey I felt a constant holy/high feeling until the point recently where I *remembered* my experience whereas before I *knew* I had experienced it but I hadn't necessarily remembered it.

507,"So I understand reagent testing for the presence of non-MDMA in the sample, and I also understand that the presence of other adulterants such as binding agents or inert powders in pressed pills won't show up in reagent testing. My question is about street/darknet MDMA powder that ""passes all the tests"" and appears to actually be MDMA; what variation chemically can there be? In other words when people say they have ""pure MDMA""  how is that different than MDMA that has no other chemical present?

Do underground labs actually create a chemical identical to the actual MDMA molecule or is there variation and why?

What have drug testing services like dancesafe etc found in terms not of adulterants but of actually presence of pure MDMA, what is the results of looking at what the market is producing?

Or from a different angle. Let's say in 5 years you can get pharmaceutical grade MDMA from your doctor. What exactly will the difference be - or will there be a difference - between pharma-MDMA with current darknet MDMA that passes all the tests? Other than consumer confidence and doctor approval?

I don't believe the sort of knee jerk answer that says ""the pharma grade will of course be better"" - I'd like to understand what is going on here.

My question arises because people who are interested in medical research on MDMA for PTSD but due to war on drugs unable to get access, and then they go to the darknet for their MDMA, get a crystalline powder that passes all the tests, and the reviews of the product are all good - can they reasonably conclude their chemical is the same?

I am in pretty dire need of some insight or advice which I have not been able to find through searches.  My Mother is a high-functioning person and very good at her job and life in general despite having suffered some terrible traumas in her past.

She has not been officially diagnosed with dissociative disorder but has recently told me that she believes this disorder most accurately describes the symptoms she has suffered from for basically her entire life.  She is a clinical therapist, and I know self-diagnosis is never a good idea, but I mention it only to suggest that she has some insight into these issues, and may be onto something.

My question is, assuming she is right, could Ayauasca help her? If it could, I want to propose this solution and since she has never done any drugs (drank almost 30 years ago) I think I should suggest a medically licensed clinic etc.

She has had a long, difficult life.  I know there are no miracle cures but was hoping someone could give me some insight on whether or not this may help her and if so, do you have any recommendations, suggestions or advice?

Thank you for reading, I't would be really nice if she could find some relief before she leaves this life and I would be very grateful for any input whatsoever.

532,"Hi everyone,

Thanks for reading this and any help or wise insight would be greatly appreciated.

I know very little about psychedelics, I had an experience in Amsterdam once with mushrooms where everyone in the city around me looked sad and confused and I saw the connection in human suffering that opened me up to compassion and loving.

I have some depression, anxiety, used to get severe panic attacks and that feeling i was going to go nuts for a while. Luckily meditation brought me life and light and i was able to pull myself out of it through self-love and compassion. Still the feelings of anxiety, instability and trauma linger around. I'd like to eradicate them or maybe relate to them differently to have a fuller, happier life, Ayahuasca found me in this sense. 

I have recently become spiritual, unmaterialistic, nature loving,  and would like to grow in that sense. My fears of this are mainly having a bad trip that sticks with me for life, losing my mind, making things worse, and losing everything i hold dear now. I've read many uplifting stories about Aya, but I can't help but focus on the horror stories i've read and critics about the retreats and their intentions. If anyone can help me out here it'd be awesome. Am i going to go nuts or fall into a sick depression if i mess with this stuff? I really like the idea of it and the potential.

Thanks and much love :)

536,"This sub-Reddit bills itself as “r/drugs but with bigger words” or “a place to discuss chemistry and pharmacology of drugs”. Being here it sure doesn’t seem that way. 

If I sliced up a typical day here, it would be something like this in a pie chart: 40% cannabis related content/posts, 30% psilocybin/psychedelic posts, 15% posts regarding anecdotal accounts of how some drug “cured” a physical or psychological affliction they had, and 15% posts that seem more appropriate for this sub Reddit. 

Yeah those numbers are exaggerated but I always notice something. Studies that show positive results of illicit drugs commonly used for recreational, non-medical purposes gets tons of discussion (mostly about anecdotal accounts or how the study “proves” that the drug is amazing, or people asking what any of the scientific terminology means) and upvotes. For example, the MDMA assisted psychotherapy study had over 40 upvotes (the older one not the current one). Meanwhile, a post I made linking to an article on the role of the TAAR1 receptor in certain types of monoamine drugs got far fewer. 

I’m not disgruntled over that, but it kind of pisses me off that people come here to support a narrative of “oh yeah, MDMA should be legal because I feel less depressed when I roll three times a week”. I just want to see more actual discussion on neurology, pharmacology, abs drug chemistry. 

And yeah my pie chart numbers are exaggerated. It’s a rhetorical tool not a true statement. The things I’m looking for do happen here, but in far fewer numbers than I would like. I just get tired of seeing cannabis, psychedelics, and ketamine featured so much here. I get it, statins are less exciting because they don’t get you high, but life isn’t always about doing that. And yeah there is interesting drug discussion in those commonly mentioned drugs I’m ranting against, but they aren’t fresh. I will try and find new stuff I’m interested in to post so I’m not just complaining.

541,"I did my third ceremony last night. My first one I was blissed out, the guy next to me said I had the biggest smile on my face. I was confused because I thought I was going to get more emotional experiences. The shaman explained that some people take time to have the difficult feelings arise. 

So I did it again. Second one I had a dance party in my head. Third, they upped my dose. That hit hard, and I was tired from the previous night. All three ceremonies I did have insights on why I think a certain way and what I'd need to change.

However, listening to everyone else describe their experience made me realize I was missing something. Literally everyone else was describing it as an emotional experience. Apart from being happy, I really didn't have any processing of emotions.

I actually am very in touch with my emotions. Not sure if this has any bearing on it, but I've become good at accepting things as they are, or seeing the positive. For example, last summer I broke my glasses, had a pot of oil explode in my face, giving me second degree burns, and had my first car accident in 12 years because I was out of it from the pain (and some shock).

My reaction? Awesome. If this is the worst day I have in awhile, I'm doing pretty damn good. 

This is also great when tripping on mushrooms. If things are unpleasant, I just think ""Ok, what's next?"" and get past things ASAP.

543,"Technically this may not be the same standard brue that most people take on retreats, but FARB and Syrian Rue still are an MAOI and (~3%) DMT combination, so the 'bones' of the concoction are there. This will be long, so bare with me.

Doseage- at T0:00 I took 2 grams of SR in capsole form. And at T0:45 I took 11 grams (holy shit, don't take this much unless you're experienced with dmt) of FARB and another g of Syrian Rue mixed with a banana-strawberry-blueberry homemade smoothie. 

Around T1:00 I felt this warm rush on the back of my head and knew that I was going to experience an ego loss. I layed back in a wicker chair on my porch and stared at the sky, but had no external hallucinations. 

At T1:15 I layed down on my side on a blanket that I had on my porch and closed my eyes. I started seeing some CEV's but most we're non-formative. The only thing I can specifically remember seeing was an image of my licking my girlfriend's buttcheek while an orgy-esque background of partially formative creatures masturbated in the background. But this image only lasted for about 2 minutes. 

Around T2:00 I thought my trip was a dud and that the FARB wasn't as potent as I thought. My other friend who took the Brew as well said he felt infinite and was playing some songs on the guitar. And he had just taken a toke from the bong because his stomach hurt a bit, so I decided to take one too since I thought nothing was going to happen. THIS IS WHERE IT GOT OUT OF HAND. About a minute after I took the hit, I start to feel very heavy and see some OEV's and I lay down on the floor. In maybe what was at most a minute both me and my friend had two very strong second waves. Mine took me to a place with a grey and white checkerboard floor with some undescribable creatures there. There were some beings that had a body shape of a pinecone, but we're covered in eyes and had hands coming out of every direction. The other beings there I cannot describe, but they were made of hands, feet, eyes, and other body parts. This imagery took me by surprise and I was beyond mystified with the experience. I saw a black and white (both colors at the same time, don't have a better way to describe) cylindar in the center of my vision leading to a black pentagon at the end. And I heard a voice in my head say that the beings around me we're spirits trying to get my attention, but only true focus could be attained by focusing on the cylindar. The checkerboard scene changed to something similar to a carnival, but not a human carnival. It was cosmic, and very foreign in design.

About T2:10 I started my ego loss and went to a place that I have visited once before on LSD called The Inside Out. The inside out is a world where my body is just a collection of stuff being held together by the infinite spirit that is open space. I saw that oxygen is the spiritual power of people and bodies are just particles being moved around like a pool toy in water. The reason we believe that we are people is because on the inside of eyes there is a mirror that reflects out and the oxygen spirit doesn't see itself and in a manic episode loses its sense of self. My friend and my trip sitter asked how I was doing because I was face down on the carpet, but all I could tell them was ""I'm in another dimension and I don't know how to feel.""

At T2:30 I went upstairs to lay down in bed, but I said that if I fall asleep that they will take me completely out of my body and I'll be completely powerless, so I only wanted to lay in the dark. After about 15 minutes of laying in the dark, a quote from the book of Thoth came to mind where he said that in the world of corners and angles he was cornered and his demons could trap him in easily. I felt so much like this and had to go to the bathroom to sit on the toilet to be in a more open space. 

While sitting on the toilet with my head in a bucket, the air got so warm because of the CO2 buildup that everything felt incredibly hot and I started sweating. I had my first thought to puke at this point, but a voice in my head told me to hold it in and that I was lost. Right after I pulled my head out of the bucket, I felt an infinite fractal spin in my head pulling me through all forms of existence, and when I opened my eyes I saw many copies of the whole room but with a different version for each color of the rainbow. I turned my head to the right and threw up in the tub, and used all my strength to not fall into the tub on the vomit. I tried to stand up and flush the toilet to go back to bed and clean the tub in the morning, but while trying to flush the toilet I lost all control of my body, took a step backwards turned around and fell face first onto the floor in the hallway.

I don't know how long I was on the floor, but my fall was loud enough to wake my girlfriend up. And she came over and laid down on the floor next to me. She asked how I was, but did have the strength to say anything. In my head I kept saying that this is what an overdose was like and that I could take the power to stop the entire universe by stopping my breathing and heartbeat. I felt like Shiva deciding to stop my cosmic dance rendering everything as non-existent. I saw carbon based life as a bucket that a god was sticking their head into and by stopping my heartbeat I could take this god's head out of the bucket of life.

In a period of about 15 minutes I came back to life (metaphorically), but it was a slow process and all I could think is that I'm happy to be alive.

Looking back on the whole experience, I'm actually glad it happened, but as people say, DMT is absolutely the most powerful experience you can go through. It was pretty terrifying at the moment, but with my first experience to this extent (I've done it twice before but never blasted off this far) I'm more comfortable with what to expect next time and have a good idea of how to mentally prepare myself for it. 

My advice: 3g SR is a good amount to take, but I'd recommend taking 7-8g of FARB.",Ayahuasca,Formosa Acacia and Syrian Rue Trip Report

If you really want to know what happened when we took the ayuascha read this, if not, ignore the message because you might not want to see. Maybe even delete it. Don't read this if you would prefer not to doubt. I didn't explain all of this at the time because what happened to us is likely an uncommon to hear, and very challenging to our beliefs.

I fell asleep immediately because it was so late, I woke up maybe 20-40 minutes later, slightly intoxicated with nausea. As the shaman had turned the lights off and began chanting - the thought ran through my head first ""at the very least, they have successfully made this experience very weird."" I thought no more of it, because it didn't bother me that things were strange.


As I wandered off to the bathroom I noticed a purity in my thinking, a smooth connection with everything, but it pointed towards the illusion of the shamanic actions - the first thing that the ayuascha ""told me"" was ""you cannot trust them"" I was confused by this statement that kept running in my head, because I was otherwise fine with what was going on besides the nausea. I just thought it was weird.

I went back to my hammock and decided to use the strength of mind of the psychedelic to look inwards. Any questions I maybe had were irradiated - I laughed at myself for thinking ayuascha could clean me. I saw myself as silly. All my problems washed away and ""the Medicine"" showed me that any questions of problems I had were merely constructions of the mind, every issue I thought I had drained away as I simply needed to choose to be new myself every second, to be new is to leave what drags you down simply and not to make the mistake to think your actions from the past chains to hold you down. I had made some mistakes but otherwise I know the proper way to behave and exist. The worst thing could be is dwell because my issues were not deep rooted, they were simple. I was clean how I was already says ""the medicine"" furthermore it told me that no psychedelic experience is superior to one another, what matters is that you use the power of the ayuascha or mushrooms, etc to see into true reality.

The overwhelming pyschedelic effect was very similar to what I have experienced many times, and the thought then passing thru my head strongly was - it was an error to think simply a new substance can bring specifically a stronger or better way of thinking as it's effects were similar. The ayuascha told me it was an error to attribute special spiritual abilities to the ayuascha experience. 


As I made this realization, my power of mind moved outward, and I reconnected to the feeling of ""at the least they have successfully made this situation very weird"" and that brought me to wonder, why? And not only that, why did Aya tell me I can not trust them?

I saw that ayuascha is a particular part of their condition, experience, and culture. I could never have a true ayuascha experience because the economic reality of a privlidged person to pay another for their own indigenous traditional experience not only puts capitalism into the equation in a culture that is already being destroyed by it. But furthermore because my upbringing I cannot fully appreciate the indigenous way, it is not made or designed for me, it is a tradition that follows not just the psychedelic substance but the actions around it. To believe something that due to its exotic and shamanic nature to heal me is a mistaken wrong view. There is no inherent value in something just for being exotic and to be in such a trance like state does not indicate spiritual healing or learning.

That's when I came back to the question, why can I not trust them? I remembered the face I saw of the shaman, during and before. It didn't scare me, its a normal face and vibration, but I recognized it for what it was with Aya in my system. It's one of greed and avarice. It's not hard to see that he is clearly not a""holy man"" although we attribute this status to him. The medicine man uses ""black magic"" or ""witchcraft"" that is to mean he uses spiritual knowledge and power to uplift himself as a shamanic figure with mystical powers. He accumulates power and money by demonstrating his magical abilities - but how does this happen. The whole ritual combined with a suggestive drug such as ayuascha enchants you, you enter a suggestive trance that has you believe making his noises of ""woosh"" and ""clean, purify, etc"" are the source of his power, but truly the source of power is the ayuascha, but it creates a trance in which he can raise his power, so that others believe him and seek his services more, not realizing that the beautiful nature of ayuascha is what brings the clear beautiful thinking. Everything is planned for a certain experience. We're told the experience is individual, yet everything is constructed to make it feel a certain way. Excessive musical notes that have a somber deep vibe spirit inviting vibe, combined with candles and shamanic rituals. What purpose does it serve to invite spirits? As westerners, do we truly even know what that means? Does taking Aya in our state give us the ability to see the world spiritually like an indigenous would? Absolutely not. Thats is a mistaken arrogant view. The drug taken at night when you're delerious from sleep deprivation, the scents, he execcsive focus on ayuascha as a ""mystical medicine"" (when even in indigenous traditional societies often times only the shaman drinks the ayuascha to understand the problems of the patient. ) creates a false authenticity, we expect what we expect and convince ourselves of the power of the shaman. Is an experience really personal when a shaman intends to induce you into a trance?

At this point I shared my feelings with my girlfriend let's call her M, who is half indigenous from the same region as the shaman, I didn't want to be pessimistic, or affect what she learned from Aya so I had waited 2 hours to even reveal anything, but to my surprise she was thinking similar ideas and was afraid she'd affect my by sharing them in case I was having a mystical valuable experience. She went to question the medicine man and the apprentice. The medicine man who many don't get to talk to fully because the language barrier was emitting stories of power and magic. How his uncle transformed himself into a tiger and he saw it with his own eyes.  M asked ""but to what end is there to transform into a tiger""

He responded ""we don't reach laypeople the way of transforming because it is dangerous, you could transform yourself into an animal and be hunted or something dangerous.""

She asked again ""what's the point though, to what end is there to transform"" the man was used to a response of simply disbelief, wonder, how is that possible, but he had likely never received a question such before. He answered in confusion, ""the point is simply to learn to transform""

If his uncle could transform - what is the purpose of telling us? How does that further the nature of the spiritual practice? It doesn't. The man uses the drug to leave us suggestible, to believe that he has hidden power from his stories. That was the end means. His objective is to use the plant to give himself power, because without it he has none. He is not a holy man, that is true. M overheard the indigenous boy who was with us ask who were the ancestors of the apprentice. The shaman said that when the boy takes Aya the next day he will have his answer.

M asked, do you believe in God or gods, he responded that he believes in Jesus Christ who when died went into the earth and grew into mother ayuascha or something like that. M asked, my jaws are clenching is that the vibration you speak of with ayuascha (aware this is a drug effect similar to ecstacy) the man touched her and reassured her ""oh yes, that is the essence of mother ayuascha"" which she felt was inauthentic. She overheard another boy say they had found their spirit animal. He proudly pats him on the back and says ""you are my jaguar"" - he uses the power of ayuascha to raise his individual self and power of suggestions, not to raise others, this is what I come to the definition of ""witchcraft/black magic"" - the permissive psychedelic state of aya leaves us suggestible to his percieved power and at any moment, any question or doubt, he brings the power to himself to uplift himself and his ability.

M asked many questions ( I was not there, I was in the hammock realizing the error I made to think that something exotic , new drug, + shamanic rituals was an answer to anything ) and she says not one answer was satisfactory, and in many cases they fumbled on their words when such strong questions were asked and couldn't handle the questions. Not one answer of the shaman or the apprentice was wise, they simple restated mystical superstitions, meant to enchant and put us in a state of awe of their power. The shaman was distressed at her disbelief. He told her, that "" los de la guajiras son fuertes, quizás necesitas otra taza"" And he said ""you're from la Guajira, how can you not believe in these mystical beliefs"" as if she should be ashamed for not being enchanted by him. No holy man would show distress at the disbelief of others. He put himself closer to her when she asked questions to the apprentice, because he saw her doubt could crush the image he has of himself, that he insulted her connection to her heritage as a dissapointment, simply because she felt mystical stories don't have value if they don't have a spiritual lesson connected. This was a man hurt by the skepticism. She saw too clearly through the facade. And he came to protect his apprentice from her lucid skepticism that could dappen his image.

At the end we had realized that the ayuascha was not a power bestowed upon the shaman. The ayuascha served as our protector and teacher against the  idea of drawing of power, greed, black magic, avarice, and overall brujería, as innate power of the shaman. Which is an illusion and lie, the shamans power depends on the ayuascha, without it he is nothing, but intends to convince us that the shaman is everything and Aya can only be understood and taken under his direction. He raises himself to a spiritual stance he does not deserve. We never were enchanted by the shamans ways to raise himself because the ayuascha protected us giving us a clear mind to analyze the situation. As clean people, with no real trauma, no addictions - we didn't have much to occupy ourselves with in focusing in ""cleaning"" by realizing so quickly that we are clean and pure in our natural state we could look outward and what we saw was the manifestation of ego in the shamanic practices, using knowledge of plants and drugs to draw dependence and belief in the shamanic magical powers. We are many to believe he has mystical powers, because he intends to do this, and successfully does under the suggestibility of ayuascha and the other plants, incense, etc. We are drawn the power of the shaman, and attribute it to him rather than the innate pure nature we have naturally within us.

The Aya did not make us confused. We did not feel afraid. We did not have a bad trip. Our minds felt clean and pure. I felt warm happiness that radiated through my body, innate nature that exists within protected against false beliefs that magic can raise us up, against false beliefs like attributing innate magical power to a man who relies on plants to create states of suggestibility. The man's magical power can only exist within the indigenous culture in which it is created. Otherwise it is a grande facade that is facilitated by intoxication.

I realized that the relationship between foreigner and shaman is a false one. The fact that we are foreigners, not even the fact that we have paid, makes the experience inauthentic as we do not understand their culture and customs. We absorb and are drawn to spiritual power as humans, especially since western culture is so devoid of spiritual practice culture or understanding. We commodify their ability and render the experience a false one. The shaman is paid and has a duty to make the people feel as if they've received something special from him. The foreigner looks for an exotic spiritual experience because our own culture is so spiritually devoid and arid. We have no spiritual culture ourselves so we attempt to buy it from others but that will never work. A shaman wouldn't give ayuascha for others in a capitalistic form because it supports accumulation and inegalitarian views, the same views that destroy their communities by the western people; By receiving payment for comodifying their spiritual tradition, we render the experience false and inauthentic. Thus any medicine man that uses his ability for personal gain is potentially betraying his people. He divilges secrets for personal gain while his community loses its autonomy, and corporations move more in on their land, destroying what is sacred to them, this likely is the most important to indigenous community, yet to believe their most experienced spiritual gurus would sell their secrets for personal gain is not something likely lauded by their community.",Ayahuasca,Never take Ayahuasca
565,"To the point, I don't take drugs anymore except some prescribed medications. Even weed/thc is legal where I am and I've some very concentrated stuff which I still have no interest in lately.

I've epilepsy. I almost died from it recently and it's rather hard to obtain appropriate prescriptions to prevent a seizure when I know one is coming or a family member to abort a massive one if it happens. My last was status epilepticus for 2 hours.

So I don't care if I have to move to another country honestly to be able to do something legally. I really don't care about myself (not that I have a death wish, I just accept it as something natural) but I don't want my family to suffer at the same time.

So I'm familiar with thienodiazepines which seem to be easier to obtain than benzos and mixing something up to take orally or for sublingual use is as simple as frying an egg. Phenobarbitol synthesis wouldn't be out of the question except not only is it clearly illegal where I live but even if I didn't care the smell would alert neighbors too much.

My primary concern is if I go into status again. I've thought of various ways for intramuscular injection to intravenous but the needle would very likely break off which I mean wouldn't be the worst thing in the muscle. Better to have surgery to remove it I suppose compared to dying.

Anyway, a PG or Iso solution isn't too awful of an idea but the chances of me inhaling them while seizing are rather high so also not the most practical.

This leaves transdermal, the safest was I can think of for a family member to try to abort a massive seizure if it were to happen again. I'm lucky to have survived the last and without any brain damage especially.

I know thienodiazepines are generally soluble in isopropyl alcohol especially at high concentrations. Thing is, it evaporates very fast as I'm sure many people are aware.

I was thinking of mixing it at a low ratio with some propylene glycol to lower the evaporation rate.   


I'm willing to test on myself if needed because honestly in low amounts this is all fairly benign. I would however prefer to not have to waste the potential ""ingredients"" if needed and testing could take a while because I'd want to wait long in between to avoid any potential tolerance skewing the results.

So if anyone has any experience or input I'd really appreciate it.

Also I'm aware of DMSO but I'm getting mixed results on it's potential neurological issues. For most things I'm not worried about my body but my brain definitely doesn't need any more problems. I also have a feeling that it's a little overblown though especially if it would only be a very minimal amount and far in between uses.

568,"Context: few days a go i did MDMA then shrooms day after to help with the depression. i got almost no visuals from the fresh shrooms which i found very odd, (maybe my serotonin receptors  wasnt working idk). I did drink moderately yesterday and woke up without a hangover.

Fast forward to this morning. took 300mg harmalas and waited exactly 1hour 10min before ingesting 100mg nn-dmt freebase. Normally i get blown into outer space within 10-20 min and puke/purge once. Didnt happen this time. After 30-40min i had basically come to terms with everything without the dmt, and then i got some visuals. Same visuals as a breakthrough though i never lost control of my body and i could only see through one eye. (closed)  It was almost like i was allowed to bring my ego with me. To add; Ive never done a low dose of aya.

After the ""trip"" was over i stood up felt refreshed and was about to head out. Right before opening my door i got really dizzy. Thought of trying to puke and just when i got to the toilet everything came spewing out.  Went back to bed just to rest. i thought the puking just came late this time.

I was wrong. the dmt started its process again of seducing me and before i knew it i had a full fledged breakthrough. I had nothing to come to terms with so i more or less enjoined there presence and the visuals.

I did write down my whole trip but its sporadic and needs a lot of work to be understandable. It was a weird one from start to finish. Not sure if you guys like trip reports or not.

​

So has anyone else experienced this ?

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: i did use benzo once because the trip got too bad. woke up 6 hours later with memory loss (as you do) and then late at night. almost 10 hours after ingesting the dmt i got a semi trip again. i was too tired at that point so i kept my eyes open and watched the fun spirals on the wall. Can dmt build up in your brain  to be released later if you take a benzo ?

So what does it claim about long-term effects of hallucinogens? (Listed are LSD, ibogaine, mescaline, psilocybin - MDMA is explicitly treated as a stimulant and NOT a hallucinogen - its side effects are listed elsewhere.) I'll add some studies countering claims in the presentation.

\*impaired concentration ('motnje koncentracije') - countering same studies as above

\*continuous anxiety ('trajna tesnoba') - this one is almost certainly true for some after a bad trip.

\*lowered intellectual abilities ('zmanjšanje intelektualnih sposobnosti') - same studies as above, again

""CB1 is responsible for the immediate and psychoactive effects of marijuana, while CB2 determines the long-term and anti-inflammatory effects.

Using marijuana can lead to tolerance, which means more marijuana will be needed to achieve the same effect. Tolerance is caused by a process called internalization. When the CB1 receptor is internalized, it means it withdraws into the cell and can no longer come into contact with THC.

Internalization doesn’t just lead to marijuana tolerance. Other receptors associated with the CB1 receptor will follow CB1 into the cell. For example, the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor is internalized along with CB1. This leads to protective effects against anxiety and epilepsy, but it also causes the temporarily impaired memory retention associated with marijuana. ""

Hi everybody !



I'm French and it is my first time posting in r/DrugNerds so excuse me if there are some mistakes or if I use the wrong language.



I also know this subject has already been discussed many times but I had some questions about certain aspects of this topic which I think haven't been raised before. It will be a bit long and technical, however I truly believe we can all benefit from the points of view some of you could offer concerning these interrogations.



I'm sure a lot of you guys remember the amazing post made by "" MisterYouAreSoDumb "" several years ago in which he gave many tips to reduce MDMA induced neurotoxicity (which can be found here https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/DrugNerds/comments/15m9sf/mdma_supplementation/#ampf=undefined).



In this post he mentions food we can consume before, during, and after the trip to achieve such a goal and also to minimize the comedown : a focus is made on the grapefruit juice, able to inhibit the CYP3A4 enzyme, responsible for the partial conversion of MDMA in its neurotoxic metabolites.



1) Here, a first question comes to my mind : since MDMA is also able to inhibit the CYPD26 enzyme mainly in charge of its metabolisation in the liver (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16714321), wouldn't drinking grapefruit juice before a roll overload these CYPD26 enzymes because of MDMA (the CYP3A4 being already inactivated), to eventually trade neurotoxicity against hepatotoxicity ? I guess the liver is still more resistant than the brain but I had to ask.
Then, the fact that "" only the CYPD26 is able to function "" after the grapefruit consumption (although almost all of is activity is canceled within an hour because of MDMA according to the previous research article), is it really safe to ingest all the compounds MisterYouAreSoDumb suggests ? Won't the liver be overloaded once again ? Won't there be some potentially dangerous over-expressions of certain of them because of these inhibitions ?



2) Furthermore, I understand the reasons why it is interesting to take
all of them, but does anybody have some solid scientific sources concerning the dosages of every substance which are mentioned ? Indeed, last time I tried these (not including the CoQ10 nor the Acetyl - L - Carnitine though), I felt my stomach a bit overloaded with all that, but the roll was perfect and the comedown pretty decent. It was mostly due to a safe dosage I think, but it certainly did help a bit. Hence, I also would've appreciated to have your point of view concerning the rolls you made after having followed such a method of supplementation, and I would like this post to eventually become a place where we can list new ways of supplementation you may think of. Do you believe the fact of supplementing only the day of the roll to be really relevant also ? I personally will begin it several days before next time I think (except for the 5-HTP of course).



3) What about the kidneys also ? Since MDMA leads to the release of the vasopressin hormone which leads to difficulties of water excretion, so the kidneys have to work more than usual, do you think it is wise to flood them with so much additionnal compounds once again ? (Assuming a wise water consumption of about 300 mL/hour for instance).



4) Assuming again a "" reasonable dosage "", to what extent is the amount of magnesium glycinate proposed by MisterYouAreSoDumb capable of reducing excitotoxicity compared to another NMDA - blocker such as memantine, which has been proven to prevent MDMA neurotoxicity, through its antagonistic action on alpha 7 - nACh receptors notably ? (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/17980434/).
Do you think 20mg of memantine before a roll is advisable, as assumed in this other post of a Reddit user testing it on himself ? 
https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/DrugNerds/comments/4rw8p5/self_testing_selegiline_to_prevent_mdma_induced/



5) Last question. A source of neurotoxicity induced by MDMA would be the oxydation of dopamine by monoamine oxydase - B once mistakenly reuptaken into the serotonergic pre-synaptic neuron as detailed in the previously mentioned post.
Its author uses a monoamine oxydase (of the B type) inhibitor (MAOI - B) to avoid this undesirable effect, called "" selegiline "", which has also been proven to greatly reduce MDMA neurotoxicity  (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11813232). Once again, do you think the dosage he evokes is safe, since once a certain threshold is reached, a MAOI-B can turn into a MAOI-A thus leading to a serotonergic syndrome ?
Couldn't the excess of dopamine hence obtained by the inhibition of its degradation lead to a greater and potentially more dangerous stimulation of the cardiovascular system (higher blood pressure, etc.), while one more time trading neurotoxicity against cardiotoxicity ? Do you know any MAOI-B (even coming from natural sources) which can be efficient and not turn into a MAOI-A once a certain dosage is reached ?




I think I'm done. Thank you if you did read the whole post , I'm waiting for your comments :)

619,"I came across an interesting piece of literature in Erowid’s Rhodium archive. It describes the synthesis of P2P utilizing acetone enolate and a halobenzene.

I’ve come across many many many ways to synthesize P2P from various precursors that are available over the counter, but this one strikes me as unbelievably simple. Of course, acquiring the halobenzene isn’t exactly the easiest thing, but it *is* available from certain chemical vendors online.

625,"A few weeks ago I experienced ayahuasca in two ceremonies, the first beginning at 10 p.m. on a Friday and the second, the following night on Saturday. The first night I consumed 2 tablespoons of ayahuasca. The second night 3. I had fasted prior to the first ceremony and had eaten very little prior to the second ceremony.

The first night the experience was mostly centered around reoccurring bouts of nausea that I was able to suppress without vomiting. I experienced some interesting visuals but afterwards my main take away was spending the majority of the night nauseous. In the morning, after leaving the ceremony and heading back to my cabin, I had a bout of diarrhea and had the sense that I had gotten the Ayahuasca out of my system that way.

The second night was quite different. The medicine did not take effect for more than an hour but, with the aid of the pounding drums of the music, I felt the first bout of nausea come on and began to throw up. Vomiting is exhausting physical activity. I hate being nauseous. And essentially, that's all I ended up doing periodically throughout the evening 7 or 8 times. I was physically beat up through the process and was so exhausted by it that there was little or nothing for me to take away from The Experience other than this physical trauma. I would merely collapse and, it seemed, pass out from exhaustion. I do however remember constantly fretting that I might lose control of my bowels as others had the night before. That concern came back to me many times through the night. I remember intellectualizing the entire process. I am a social scientist and by nature a skeptic (not a pessimist-big difference). I remember thinking that this is what people meant by 'doing the work'. It meant self-flagellation. 'Work' meant suffering through this. It was as though the ayahuasca would ask me, 'can you go again'? 'Can you throw up again?' And, drenched in my own sweat, I would submit until eventually I was too weak to throw up anymore and just lay there trying to stifle the nausea. I was beat up. I remember thinking people are characterizing this purging, this vomiting as getting rid of pain and suffering and guilt or whatever it is that ails them when really what has happened is that we all have ingested a nausea inducing psychedelic that has us tripping and throwing up at the same time. In short, it was physically brutal and exhausting and by the time it was all over I was numb with exhaustion.

Also, I should add I came into this adventure with no problems that I was trying to solve. I am not an addict, don't suffer from PTSD or any other issue. In fact, currently, my life has never been better. I have a job in academia that I have enjoyed for the past 30 years and a wonderful family and home. I am lucky. Things have turned out well for me. Much of the struggle dealing with childhood trauma and so forth I had worked through earlier in my life. I am at peace with all that now. I am 63 years old and in a good place. I wasn't looking to solve anything - just to expand my consciousness. 

I must say that my experience was in stark contrast to the vast majority of all the other participants who seem to have had very revelatory and overall positive experiences.

For whatever reason my experience centered around the repeated trauma of vomiting. To hear that music sends a chill down my spine and I almost feel the nausea coming back. The thought of that result makes me chuckle somewhat. It wasn't what I expected.",Ayahuasca,I feel almost traumatized by my Ayahuasca experience
626,"Edit: Taar1 antagonism not agonism.

With daily use of phenibut tolerance builds to effects of Gaba B. But does the positive effects of the drug on voltage-dependent calcium channels and its antagonism of taar1 stay with continued use or do they too accumulate tolerance by downregulating etc.

Also after using two weeks in a row at 2g a day, I felt the tolerance come and mild withdrawal effects began without reducing or increasing the dose from 2g a day. After that passed after about 3 days from first realising the tolerance was coming, some nausea, anxiety, insomnia, pain, very mild. Currently on stable dosage of 40mg paroxetine though and used propranolol and cannabis to mitigate some of the withdrawals. I have now leveled out without any of those withdrawal symptoms and continuing at 2g a day. So the withdrawal started after 2 weeks without changing dose, lasted 3/4 days, and then stopped all without changing the dosage.

I still feel like I am less agitated than without phenibut, so I wonder if the gabapentinoid and taar1 effects are the reason I still have some benefit of phenibut despite tolerance to its effects on Gaba B.

It could also just be placebo effect but basically how I can tell is, I meditate. Without phenibut I get fairly agitated and pain fairly quickly, but even now as I meditate with Gaba B tolerance I still find it less painful and agitating than without Phenibut. Still this effect on meditation could be placebo feeling making me less anxious and therefore less agitated.

Problem is I feel like I've lost some of the motivating effects of Phenibut due to tolerance.

I'm aware of dangers and withdrawal tapering, no advice needed.",DrugNerds,"With Phenibut, tolerance builds to Gaba B but does it build to effects of voltage-dependent calcium channels and taar1 agonism?"

631,"It has been about a year since my Ayahuasca experience in Peru, and I wanted to share how I'm doing now.

Immediately after I returned home, things were going pretty great. The afterglow was awesome, but I'll admit, my anxiety (which was the main reason I went) wasn't improved all that much. A couple of months later, things got so bad to the point where I decided to go back on an SSRI. I was upset, to be honest. After all the judgement I received from friends and family for doing this, I felt like I didn't even receive the healing I was looking for.

Well, after some more time in therapy, I decided that in order to free myself from my anxiety, I had to push myself outside my comfort zone as much as possible. I was originally going to be going to community college for two years before going to an 'actual' college, but I decided to go to 'actual' college after my first year of community college. It was scary leaving home, but I did it, and I have to say, I'm happier.

Everyday I've been challenging myself to test my anxiety to its limits, and everyday I find my comfort zone is growing. I even quit SSRIs again. I found that what I needed wasn't medication, but exposure. Now, maybe the Ayahuasca retreat was good for me, in the sense that it was the first time I pushed myself that far outside my comfort zone. But to be completely honest, I'm not sure the Ayahuasca played much of a part. I think just going on a simple meditation retreat abroad would achieve similar results.

I'm not sure what to think about all this. I'm still healing, but I'm doing much better than I was a year ago. I'm happy, and I guess that's all that matters.",Ayahuasca,One Year Later

642,"Edit: update on the bottom!

Going to a Ayahuasca retreat in a few days and I am currently addicted to kratom. I am a heavy user, taking probably 20g a day on average and if I go 12ish hours without it I start to withdrawal. Withdrawals feel a lot like flu symptoms, hot and cold flashes, sweaty, restless, crawling skin, intense anxiety and depression, etc.

So I am in a predicament. I am in the deepest depression of my life and I want to try Ayahuasca. But I am addicted to kratom and I have read around the net that this is a dangerous combination. I would probably take 2 doses of kratom in the day before my Ayahuasca ceremony. One when I wake up, probably noon, and one around 7pm, those doses would be 5 grams probably, just enough to keep me out of withdrawls.

Should I go to the retreat? I've already paid the deposit and I don't think I will get it back, but I also don't want to fuck myself and have a really bad experience because of a reaction to kratom.

Edit: I ended up going to the retreat, I tried to keep the kratom to a minimum so took one tablespoon dose a day like 12 hours before the ceremony, I also took 20mg of oxy a couple times before or after taking the Ayahuasca when my pain was bad or I felt wd symptoms. I am more comfortable taking opiates on Aya than kratom, as kratom has more alkaloids that could interact and there is less info online about combining kratom and Aya.

The experience itself was okay. Nothing lifechanging unfortunately, maybe I was blocked by the opiates. But I'm still very depressed and still in a lot of physical pain. One night I spent going in circles in my head about the darkness and unjustness in this world, and my own suffering. maybe I will look back in a few weeks and think differently about it, maybe the medicine is still working in me. 

Just wanted to throw this update up incase someone else with a kratom addiction is searching for answers about combining Aya and kratom. This is just my experience.",Ayahuasca,"Addicted to kratom, can I take Ayahuasca?"

647,"**tl:dr 24 year old cancer survivor who has been contemplating having powerful psychedelic experience has suddenly come across a genuine ayahuasquero and may have an opportunity to partake in a ceremony.** 

Some quick background info:

I work at a flotation center, so as you can imagine I meet tons of cool and heady people who are into altered states of consciousness. I love providing the sensory deprivation experience and chatting with them afterwards. Recently I met a guy(he was late to his appointment and rescheduled) and we immediately began chatting about psychedelics, depression, and specifically how I don't trust those ayahausca retreats that are offered in big cities because its usually a couple of yuppies who traveled to peru, partook in a ceremony and now believe they are shamans and can facilitate these experiences.

He agreed, and said I should be super wary, and not to trust 9 out of 10 of them. Fast forward a week later to his appointment. He had a great float, and had mentioned how he recently gave a talk about plant medicine. I was intrigued, and asked if he had any published writings or a blog I could read. He gave me his number and address and told me to come by for a chat one day. But then, he looked at me and was like, ""you know what, I think you have your head on your shoulders. Look into this name, but you cannot connect me to it and cannot mention me in any form regarding it"". I googled it right on the spot, and lo and behold this whole time I was speaking to a genuine ayahuasquero, a certified shaman with extensive experience who works directly with the shaman who initiated him in Peru. We looked at each other and simply nodded in confirmation. I'm refraining from typing his shaman name, as I have come across several threads from people seeking him. He works strictly through word of mouth, and does not offer ceremonies to just anyone. In fact, he turns away most people who somehow find him. I was humbled and in awe that this just fell into my lap, as I have been contemplating a serious psychedelic experience sometime soon, due to reasons I will now explain.

&amp;#x200B;

About myself:

I am 24 years old, turning 25 next month (December). I was raised with a holistic/naturopathic background, so I have been familiar with various plants and herbs all my life and often turn to plants before doctors if I am ever feeling ill. I don't think it's anything special, it's just the culture that my family comes from. When I was 15 my mother suffered a massive stroke, and it threw me into a deep depression. A few years later she was diagnosed with end stage kidney failure, and is now on dialysis for the rest of her life. I became, and still am, her caretaker. It has profoundly changed my views on health and love, and I now cherish the remaining time I have with her, but I cannot get my mind off the amount of suffering she goes through. Her impending death is a huge source of anxiety in my life. I began experimenting with psychedelics, and they helped change my perspective on life and begin to live a life of compassionate action. So with a combination of meditation, eastern literature, floating, and the occasional trip, I have begun to finally feel a sense of confidence in who I am as a person, and how to spend my time here on earth. But then, a year ago, I was diagnosed with stage 4 hodgkins lymphoma. I won't go into the details of that, but the point is I was losing myself to fear and anxiety of dying. Most people can say they aren't afraid of death, but when the timer is actually ticking, all that shit goes out the window. I was so afraid that I even put off chemotherapy, because I was convinced that it would do more harm than good, and I would 100% be a goner. These fears were irrational, as lymphoma is highly treatable today, but Fear often creates such a powerful illusion that we can end up believing we are taking actions to fix things when in reality we are just hiding and sinking more and more into delusion. Eventually though, I was put into treatment, and to the amazement of my doctors I am tolerating chemotherapy better than anyone they have seen. I have zero side effects, and according to my blood work I am extremely healthy. My fear of death has melted away, and now I am filled with a consistent source of love and appreciation for life and all that it has to offer. I am not overly optimistic, as I know life is unpredictable, but for right now I feel really good, the best I have ever mentally and emotionally ever felt about life. 

Now to the point of this post. As a celebration of overcoming this fucked up part of my life, I really want to have a serious psychedelic experience. I have been contemplating smoking DMT for my 25th birthday. I have not actively searched for a source, as I believe these experiences should happen organically and will often find you when the time is right. Now I have come across this guy at work, and I think I want to partake in a ceremony. My intention is to process the psychological stress I have been through, make peace with my mother's impending death, and to also see in what ways I can improve my character. I feel so good about life that I really can't think of any serious aspects of myself I need to change besides just continuing on my current path. I want to find new perspectives, and become aware of any fears I may have but aren't aware of. 

Do any of you think this a good intention, should I go for it, and what have your experiences been regarding the themes of death and fear?

657,"TL;DR: Much sobbing and catharsis. Fever dream-like. Sense of ""other-world"" that led to my core. Very intense and uncomfortable. Felt appreciation for my humanity and familiar waking life. Came out the other end feeling euphoric. Hava Nagila.

I've been fascinated by psychedelics since I was a teenager, but never gave them a go because my grandmother had schizophrenia (my mom believes it might have been a misdiagnoses since this was in communist Poland). Recently, my own mental wellbeing has veered towards depression, anxiety, and insomnia worst of all, so I decided that under the right conditions, an aya experience may help me.

It was a group of men, all making for good company. The facilitators were sufficiently experienced and provided a familiar but authentic ceremony. I skipped the rapé and tobacco since it makes me overly nauseous. A ""microdose"" of San Pedro was given. I didn't feel it, but that was the point. Finally, after a prayer, the facilitators began serving the brew.

I don't mind the taste. It's like kratom, just earthy and a little salty. I was told since it's my first time that I would be given slightly less, but could ask for more on the second cup. I think I got about as much as everyone else, and due to intensity, I did not need a second cup.

The lights were turned off, leaving just the central candlelight and some small lamps for reading. There were songbooks passed around to sing along with the facilitators. This ceremony was meant to focus more on a mild, controllable experience that would allow for singing and sitting up. At first, people sang and waited. I felt apprehensive to singing because I was tired from poor sleep and I spent all day fasting and lugging my stuff to the event. I like singing with others, but I was a little moody.

I saw a single candle move. Ten minutes later, a deep heaviness came over me, followed by nausea. I felt very weak and uncomfortable on my yoga mat. I lay down and surrendered to the experience. It felt like a fever dream at first. In my dream, I saw strange patterns like amoebas, greens, yellows, and browns. I had the sense that this dream realm hosted insect-like beings and a sense of ugliness, but also reassurance. In comparison, my human realm seemed nobler. I felt so blasted that I had to accept many things I normally wouldn't such as this ugly feeling. My first thoughts were, ""I get why people are cautious about this. This is *so much.* I don't ever want this again. I am in for it now and must let it happen."" My sweat and the heat of the room added to this dream making it feel like being in a humid jungle. I was going to my core. It was at this point that I began sobbing deeply. I cried a lot about feelings of abandonment and negligence from my parents, mostly from when I was small and they divorced. It felt good to cry. I felt safe. I was on the floor, rocking and crying, while the men sang. Some lyrics sneaked into my awareness, which only added to my catharsis. ""I went down, and He lifted me up.""

After I cried most of it out, I began breathing heavily. I felt like I would forget how to breathe unless I kept consciously breathing. I remembered the video of the woman doing 4-MeO-DMT and getting damn near suffocation. I was scared I might die since it was so intense and I felt so heavy, but I reminded myself that it will be okay. Perhaps my poor sleep was the main reason for this heaviness. I wasn't overtaken by this fear, just perturbed. I have experience with cannabis paranoia, so I just stayed calm. The helpers were around me, fanning me, blowing smoke, and whispering what sounded like prayers. I calmed down a little, but I felt nauseous and uncomfortable on the floor, so I kept rocking and they had to move my legs away from the altar. A man whispered to me that I would feel better if I sat up so I did, but I felt too tired and lay back down. I was just trying to get through the nausea and intensity and fears of death and insecurity. I was breathing so much that my hands had pins and needles and my jaw muscles were tight. I couldn't open my jaw much. This coupled with dissociation made it hard to speak. The same man reassured me and asked me to stand and breathe with him. I felt like an alien learning to be human. It was difficult. I was weak and dizzy, so I sat back down and started coming down soon after.

After the ""wet"" and mushed together realm, I saw a lot of triangular geometry. I knew it made no sense to me because I was not of those worlds, at least consciously, and I was so grateful I was a human that would return home to what made sense. My hearing was highly enhanced and reverberant. Every time a song ended, the cacophony of the other men making sounds, throwing up, blowing noses, laughing, whispering would set in, like a jungle alive at night. I would fidget with my hands and arms a lot to tap my chest with my fists and make prayer hands. I felt like I was being put through a warrior experience and was showing my gratitude and my resilience. I had some realizations about my life, some sad, some hopeful. I spent too much time ignoring the world and distracting myself. I felt at peace with the possibility of taking antidepressants in the future. I realized how precious my relationships are with my parents, especially my mother. I felt more at peace with myself and open to having fun. Once I came down enough to be present again, I was in a joyous/euphoric mood, thinking of problems I had that suddenly felt simple. I would giggle when I remembered how intense the experience was and how happy I was to be past it. For the rest of the night I felt relaxed and comfortable and happy. I sang some songs and rested some more. My physical discomfort was gone and made way for acute relaxation. The floor was just fine. My favorite song from that night was Hava Nagila funnily enough. There was rave going on next door to this place (to the facilitators dismay), but we all laughed and enjoyed the pounding music whenever our songs ended.

The event ended with some more tobacco and marijuana passed around. I again refused for personal reasons. Everyone was mostly supportive and happy that I had my experience. They gave me advice to sit up more next time, but I didn't take this to heart because they had no idea how strong it was for me. I am annoyed that the organizer said ""It's okay if it happens once,"" regarding my loss of control. Maybe he meant it more in the context of this particular event's setup, but that is not an attitude I would take with this medicine. That was the only problem with this ceremony for me. It's my own insecurity that causes me to feel overly hurt by the ""advice,"" but also a minor insensitivity on the part of others.

As for integration, I slowly reintroduced my ""old"" way of life. So far, I think the main benefit was the release of emotion, though there isn't much conscious effect just yet. I have noticed I have slightly less social anxiety and am somewhat ""goofier,"" but it's so mild it's hard to tell. I am going to try microdosing mushrooms very soon before I decide that antidepressants are the way to go for me.

It had been ten years since my last deployment to Iraq. My wife said if it didn't work she would take the kids and leave me. 

I spend a week in the jungle and underwent three ceremonies. While there, (without my emotionally and physically abusive covert narcissist wife) I was happy, sane, and looking forward to a bright future full of love, compassion and helping others.  

I was sane for the first few days back. Then she started back in with the blame, emotional abuse, manipulation, etc, etc. etc. Knowing how good I had it in Peru - how I was the person I wanted to be there - surrounded by good kind people from all over the world - but now I'm back this with evil witch - it was disheartening to say the least. Like my wounds were reopened and salt rubbed back in.

I thus began a maddening downward spiral culminating in separation and divorce. Has anyone one out there had a similar experience. Has anyone else spiraled after returning? I miss the jungle.

I planned to follow Dieta, do yoga and mediatate in the weeks leading up to it. I haven’t done any of it. I just don’t have the motivation or interest, and I guess in a way it’s one of the many forms of self Sabotage and the ways I mistreat my self.

That’s not to say I’m not taking ayahuascha seriously. I am. I spend much of my days reading and researching. I’ve done Kambo in the months leading to the ceremony and I finally got myself off Anti depressants that you are not allowed to take with ayahuascha.

This quite literally means the world to me. Even more so the world, my life kind of depends on it. I can’t bare the thought of returning back to my life and feeling this chronic sadness and insecurity I’ve felt since I was a child.

The last week or so it’s as if, mentally, I have stopped trying. It’s hard to put into words, but it feels like surrendering to how I really feel. I’ve stopped running. I’ve finally fallen with exhaustion after all these years of carrying the pain. I’m lay in the rain and I’m waiting. It kind of feels like I’m dying. And I’m waiting to see if I’m reborn. I wish for nothing more than total transcendence from this life. I don’t want this life anymore. My avatar is tired of playing this character. 

I know  that sounds dramatic but it’s the only way I can try to articulate how I feel.

I just wanted to share it, I guess, and your advice or input would be appreciated. Did any of you feel similar to this? 
Thank you for reading.

Ps.... I know that ayahuascha can’t magically change my life and make it all rainbows and butterflies. I am trying to walk the thin balance rope of having intentions and also not expecting anything because she will decide what I need. All I want, is what I need? That’s my only intention.",Ayahuasca,Feeling strange before ceremony...

668," Been wondering about this for a while now. MDMA has been showing a lot of promise as a treatment for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and will likely become an available treatment in the near future. So how is this justified against it’s known neurotoxicity? Is that in its usage for PTSD a protocol is used the minimizes it’s neurotoxcicity that I’m not aware of? Or is it just a risk vs, benefit scenario whereby if someone has PTSD so severe it requires MDMA treatment the neurotoxicity is considered only a small risk vs the possible benefit? 

We're all aware of the research on MDMA and neurotoxicity, but when it comes to humans its inconclusive at best. Some studies iirc indicated it actually wasn't toxic at all where as the studies which focused on heavy use showed clear neurotoxicity.

I suspect that physical extremes and ""high information density"" regions (such as the center of a star (or possibly even a planet) with high pressure and temperature) may be worthwhile candidates to investigate as potentially containing something that we may be able to think of as consciousness.

So, I’ve been on antidepressants for years now. Currently I am on Wellbutrin/Bupropion SR 150mg 2x a day, which I am trying to taper off since I feel my life has been stable for a while now, I eat good and I go to the gym. I started antidepressants when I was 12, and just kinda stayed on them and did not know it wasn’t something I don’t have to be on for the rest of my life. 

Consulted my doctor, the tapering schedule he suggested seemed too quick for me, so I’ve decided to go slower. I quit Cymbalta cold turkey twice in the past and do not want to experience that again. I did 75% of a pill twice a day for 3 weeks and I actually felt better than I did with the full dosage, which gave me some hope that the taper will be good for me. I’ve been at 50% of a pill twice a day for 5 days, and it honestly has been terrible. Very agitated and irritated, random headaches. The weird thing is, is that I noticed my breasts leaking a milky discharge since tapering, and I’ve experienced vaginal dryness and lowered sex drive, which is not fun at all. I am not pregnant. I’m more upset over the latter compared to the irritation and headaches.

Frantically searching the internet (not initially thinking it had to do with my meds) I learned that increased dopamine lowers prolactin, a hormone responsible for the lactating and dryness/lowered sex drive. I’m assuming that tapering off of Wellbutrin, which operates on dopamine receptors, lowers my dopamine and thus increases the prolactin. Okay. So, my question is, do I finish the taper and hope my body will level itself out? I’m very afraid that I will finish, but still be left with the agitation, shot sex drive, and vaginal dryness. I don't know whether to think these are simply withdrawal symptoms, or what my base level is.

My past 2 doses I went back up to 75% because I’m stupid, so it’s been about 16 ish hrs since going up and my sex drive feels fine now, and I don’t feel agitated. I have headaches, but I figured that much. I’m nervous that I do actually have to stay on it, especially considering I’ve been on some sort of pill for 10 years. Do I finish the taper?

I sent messages to my doc and ob to see what their input is. I would like to know anyone else’s input from experiences or anything.",DrugNerds,Nervous over side effects of getting off of wellbutrin- lowered sex drive

(This is entirely a work of fiction done as a creative writing exercise. I have never done any hallucinogenic drugs)

I’ve wanted to do ayahuesca for the past several years. My main motivation was to find out about myself, get insight into prolonged career path frustration I’ve been feeling and to help me figure out a variety of personal issues which would be hard to explain in less than 20 or so pages. Factoring into this is the fact that I’m trans and I’m trying to understand issues related to this.

I’ve tripped before, although I’m far from an experienced psychonaut. I’ve done acid four times, shrooms once. The first two times were very beautiful, I felt I had profound experiences, the other times not so much.  

Peru seemed a bit out of my price range, although I am considering it for the future. There are “churches” which legally perform “ceremonies” in the US.  I seemed to get an odd feeling from some of these groups, they seemed to be attempting to almost create a monopoly over the experience.  I got a good feeling from the Arizona Yage assembly. They host ceremonies around the US. Two years ago they came to near where I live. I spoke with them on the phone, they seemed really cool but it was a very bad time for me and I couldn’t do it.

I’m in a much better situation now.  Several times this spring and summer I almost signed up for a ceremony with AYA. Still the logistics seemed too complicated, flying there and back, (while fasting) taking time off from work, etc.  I decided to make ayahuesca myself, from a recipe I got online.  To my surprise I found a recipe  which seemed basic and straightforward.

The recipe was easy but time consuming, taking me three days to make. It produced a strong vinegar smell though out my house which was very annoying. I live alone, just me and my dog, Cupcake, and I’m in a semi-rural area, so I didn’t have to worry about neighbors. I’m having a contractor do remodeling on the other end of my house. He’s a hippy type guy, his partner is in the medical marijuana business so I’m sure he’d be cool about what I was doing but I didn’t feel the need to tell him.

Around 5:30 am of the second day I was cooking the brew my dog, who sleeps right next to my bed, had a seizure. I was worried it had something to with what I was making, the powerful smell of which permeated my house, although I’m certain she didn’t drink any of it. Later on in the day I took my dog to the vet. For obvious reasons I didn’t tell them what I was doing. The vet couldn’t find anything wrong with her. I felt a bit guilty though.

The brew was finished on Sunday. I decided I would use it on Monday. I took the day off from work. I fasted. I’m not a food oriented person, but on the other hand I definitely feel it if I miss a meal and I felt increasingly faint and light headed though out the day. I ran errands, paid bills, and got supplies for the contractor. Thinking I’d be ravenous after I came down I bought several large bags of Chinese food from a local takeout. By late afternoon I didn’t feel I could drive anymore and I stayed home, mostly watching ayahuesca Youtube videos and listened to Terrence McKenna talks.

I waited until 8 pm to begin the proceedings. Later I realized I hadn’t been as fully prepared as I should have been. I didn’t fully understand the importance of the icaro to the journey. I relied on Youtube videos, which later proved to be a mistake. Cupcake was with me. She’s a great dog, incredibly cute and affectionate but also a very needy dog. This was to prove a problem. Also, I should have gotten something to put over my eyes, I used my hands instead. Okay..

I drank yage tea, as a MAO inhibitor. It was bitter but not nearly as bad as I had expected it would be. After the first two sips I immediately felt a very mellow buzz. I forced myself to down the cup and then ate the remaining dregs.

After about an hour I drank the half a cup of mimosa tea I had carefully measured out. It was very bitter with an odd hint of sweetness. It didn’t taste super terrible. I played with Cupcake, hoping she’d soon be tired out. I joked with some friends on messenger, although I didn’t tell them what I was doing. Ten o’clock rolled around, nothing happened. Then I had a feeling of nausea. It quickly passed. I waited another 15 minutes or so, then concluded that that was it, nothing was going to happen. I thought I probably screwed up the brew. I was partly relieved, partly disappointed. I microwaved some of the chicken fried rice I had bought earlier in the day. After two spoonfuls I felt the nausea return. It was much worse. I hadn’t eaten all day and I was hungry I had another spoonful .Its hard to explain but I felt as I someone was telling me “don’t do this”.  Then I felt as if a voice was telling me, “I know you’re hungry, I’m not going to make you vomit and lose what you have in your stomach, but its important that you don’t eat anything else.” Okay. I put the food back in the fridge. Some degree of nausea remained though out the rest of trip but most of the time it was in the background. I tried to figure out what time I had started this. I drank the yage tea at 8 pm and the mimosa at 9. It seemed to be very difficult for me to understand this. I had trouble understanding the whole concept of time. Something was happening.  I started to walk towards my bedroom, I don’t remember why. Then it hit, big time. I was definitely tripping, the first time I’ve tripped in over ten years.

I made my way back to the living room couch, set up the Youtube video and lay down with hands over my eyes.  I started seeing geometric patterns, like the videos I had been watching earlier, then I seemed to be in some sort of highly mechanical tubular world . There were Lego like things moving and I felt, but didn’t see, gears cranking. I didn’t see the elves Terrence McKenna and others talk about (unless those were the Legos) but otherwise so far it correlated with what I’ve heard about.

Its hard to explain but I felt a voice, or some entity using my own mental voice, speaking to me. I had a strong feeling of this being as a teacher, as being in this Lego world to teach me. I experienced a period where my thoughts were echoed back at me.  There were several instances where I thought something, and the thought was thrown back at me, only with all its hidden ramifications shown, like a weird dialectical process. I don’t remember what the specific thoughts were. I got the feeling the entity was showing me this as introducing its teaching methodology.

The entity said, (or conveyed) to me that it had been trying to teach me in dreams. I briefly experienced a fragment of a recent dream. In the dream fragment were three entities, like giant mud creatures, but this receded very quickly. I couldn’t tell if the entity had been actually successful in teaching me in my dreams.

Back track a bit. Its a long story but I had a huge mouse problem in my house. Six months or so ago it was really bad, I could hear them at night. I am dealing with the problem, I’m patching up entryways and I had an exterminator come several times. Because I have a dog I put out glue traps. A couple of times this didn’t kill the mouse right away, I could see them struggling on the trap. This weirded me out. It was disturbing and I felt very guilty about this. Okay…

After the experience of having my thoughts thrown back at me, I saw a mouse struggling. It was very vivid and disturbing. Then I saw a hawk picking up a mouse in a field. I felt it was as if the entity was trying to tell me, “don’t feel bad about killing mice. They’re killed by predators in the wild all the time. The bottom line is that I had a need to kill mice and I shouldn’t feel bad about this. Its okay to kill mice”.

Another back track; earlier in the summer I had a huge fly problem. For several weeks in July and then into August there were masses of flies in my house. I couldn’t figure out what was attracting them. I’m doing home renovation. Shortly after the fly problem started I realized I had left several bags of garbage outside next to this house which I’d forgotten about. Could this be drawing them? I took the garbage to the town dump. The flies wouldn’t go away though. At several points there seemed to be thousands of them at night. I would keep several lamps on in the living room at night and I’d find hundreds of flies gather around the lampshades. It was disturbing. I couldn’t tell what was drawing the flies, I made sure to promptly take out the garbage and keep it away from the house. One day I swept the kitchen floor. The flies abruptly disappeared after this, although I didn’t think this could be the causal factor. The whole episode was one of the strangest things I’ve ever encountered.

Okay, after I had the visions of mice the entity told me, “I brought the flies to you. The purpose was to teach you something”. I don’t know what the entity was trying to teach me. To be honest I haven’t been the world’s greatest housekeeper, I have been messy and not as clean as I could have been. My hunch is that I was being told I had to step up my game in this regard. Anyway since that event several weeks ago I haven’t found a single fly in the house.

Much of the rest of the trip seemed to be in a weird sort of cylindrical multi colored world, although the world itself seemed to be more in the background.

Several times at the beginning of the trip my attention flagged a bit. The entity said to me, “You went though all the trouble and expense to be here, don’t you want to see what I’m teaching you?” This happened twice. I thought about being hungry. The entity said to me something like, “you’re having this profound experience, and all you could think about was being a little hungry?”

The entity showed me that I have a lot of anger inside. I’ve had major issues with my sister over the past few years. I also have anger relating to being trans, the fact that I’m adopted, and a lot of other things going way back. The entity briefly showed  me this but stopped me from exploring it, as if saying, “don’t get hung up on your anger, just be aware its there”.  My anger towards my sister and others may be fully justified I was told several times.  “I’m not saying the anger isn’t justified, I’m just showing you its extent and what its been doing to you”. The entity was non-judgmental. It was as if I was in charge and was just being shown the “whole story” about the situation.

I was then shown that, related to the anger I was feeling, I’m very judgmental, of both myself and others. I’m adopted. This past January, after years of on and off searching, I found out who my biological parents were though two genetic testing services. Shortly after this I connected with two paternal step-siblings who I didn’t know I had until recently. The previous week I had an hour and a half conference call with them. It went well and I thought we had a good talk. Afterwards I felt a bit disappointed. My step-siblings seemed like nice people but they didn’t at all fit the image I had built up over the years of what they would be like.

The entity, in effect, showed me that I was being harshly judgmental and typing people a lot. My step-siblings were very nice people who had reached out to me, in an awkward situation, and I was harshly judging them in my own mind.

Related to this I saw I have been harshly judgmental towards myself. I’m constantly mentally putting myself down though out the day. There were several periods during the trip where the entity kept telling me, “you’re okay, you’re okay”.

At one point I sort of asked the entity for career advice. “What should I do?” The answer was to the effect that, “I’m just telling you what you need to know at this time”. I have an interest in Norse mythology and to some extent I identify with the Vikings, although I’m not really a Heathen or an Asatruer. I tried to ask for Freya or Odin. The answer I got was, “you can’t call on the gods, its strictly up to them if they want to make their presence known”.

For much of the trip I was bounced around between the several visions or teachings I described, which seem to be like “stations”.

I went though a period where I kept saying, “I’m sorry, I’m sorry”. Its difficult to describe. Much of the trip wasn’t really pleasant. I thought many times, “this is fu...g weird” but I can’t say what about it exactly was weird. I had the feeling it was disturbing and at times even terrifying, but I can’t say exactly why it was. Maybe it was the just the fact that I was tripping on a powerful hallucinogen. I did get a sort of vague “Christmas Carol” vibe, like the Ghosts of Christmas Past were visiting me. It seemed much of the information I had received was unconscious or subliminal. My life was being reviewed, much of it had been found wanting and I was apologizing for whatever it was that I had done in an attempt to make it stop. These are ideas I got a few days after the trip to try to make sense of the way I felt. I just remember that I kept apologizing to try to somehow make this thing stop.

As I mentioned, logistically I wasn’t as well prepared as I should have been.  While having the visions, I could “resurface” and I was aware of the outside world. At one point I peaked out and saw my dog watching me. I thought it looked like she was aware that something was going on with me. A while later I heard her crying. This meant she had to go outside and pee and I was ignoring her. Cupcake is very much of a princess dog. She’s spoiled rotten. When its raining out, or even if there is a high pressure front and a hint of rain, as was the case that night, she simply won’t go out, no matter how badly she has to relieve herself. I have to literally pick her up and carry her out. Fortunately she’s a very small dog. So I picked up my dog and carried her outside. As I got up I was dizzy and felt an increase in nausea. I watched Cupcake in my driveway for a time. I thought about my nausea, centered around my lower gut. Was it psychosomatic or was it due to irritating my stomach, perhaps from the acidic teas I drank, on an empty stomach to boot?  I kept going back and forth on this. For some reason it was important for me to figure this out. When I thought about the anger I had realized I had had, the nausea increased, when I stopped thinking about it I felt fine. I still couldn’t really decide which was the cause of the nausea.

I then thought I ought to ignore my dog and just go back inside and continue. I got back to my sofa. It wasn’t working. I couldn’t leave Cupcake outside the rest of the night. I again went out, got her, then lay on my bed instead of the sofa. I thought that there would be less of a chance of Cupcake disturbing me if I was on my bed. I set up an icaro video on my phone. Unfortunately the video I set up had ads. I got back into the visions but I was interrupted four times, the first three with an ad for a law firm specializing in medical malpractice and the third an ad for some dietary supplement. The first two times I got very annoyed, the third time I could see the ad, sandwiched as it was  between hallucinatory visions, as hilariously funny. I finally got a video which looked like it would give me 90 minutes with no interruptions and I got back into the visions.

I saw how the icaro chanting/drumming was integral to the experience. I could feel the shaman, or shipabo, pulling me along in the chant. At several points it seemed to take me over. Twice I caught myself dancing in bed to the beat, with my feet bouncing rhythmically in one direction and my head in the other.

The entity scolded me several times. Once I was in a grassy clearing in a wooded area, at dusk. The entity said, “you really don’t have your shit together for this, do you?” Then it said, “you ought have planned this out better, but its all good, I’m very glad you’re here and let’s continue”. Another time the entity brought me to a sort of gate. It looked like the Stargate in the TV series and movie of the same name. It told me to the effect that that was the gate to the Hidden Realms. The entity didn’t use the term “Hidden Realms” but I got that feeling, this was the gateway to a higher level of what I was experiencing. I wouldn’t be allowed to go though it because I wasn’t prepared. Some time after this (of course the concept of time seemed to lose meaning in this visionary world) the entity just roundly scolded me. “you don’t have your shit together for this”.

I though about or saw a friend of mine, also trans, who is a severe diabetic. Recently she almost had a foot amputated. I saw myself with my friend in a coffee shop, my friend was drinking a huge chocolate shake. My friend is a very unhappy person, constantly complaining about her life. It occurred to me that she’s committing slow motion suicide. I realized that I had been avoiding my friend for quite a while, even though I live about an hour away because something about her was disturbing to me. I thought that I should try to reconnect with her. I’m not sure if the thoughts about my friend were from the entity or from myself, probably a mix of both. Thinking about her though the entity told me not to be harsh, judgmental or feel superior. “Back out, back out” , I felt the entity telling when I started to analyze what was going on with my friend.

As I mentioned much of the trip didn’t seem pleasant especially towards the end of the experience. I said to myself several times, “when does this damn thing end?”I peaked at my phone. It was a little after 3 am, closing in on the end, according to my rough estimate.

I had strong feelings of gender dysphoria and saw sexual imagery which related to that. I finally felt myself coming down. Interestingly I still saw the sexual imagery for a while after I came down.

It was close to 4 am when I fully came down. I felt the entity was telling me I should take another dose. I didn’t. I said to myself, “I don’t want to go though another 4 hours of that shit”. I mean “that shit” somewhat jokingly, it was an intense experience and I’m glad I did it but I wasn’t anxious to go though it again, at least not right then.

I laid in bed for a while. I thought I had the day off from work and I wanted to spend the morning processing what I had experienced. I have several jobs. For one of them I work part time at a group home for developmentally delayed adults (its not as interesting as it sounds). I got a call a little after 8 am. It was my supervisor at the group home. Apparently several weeks earlier I had agreed to fill in a shift and the supervisor was wondering where I was. Oh shit! I quickly got dressed. I was okay to drive and the home was only about two miles from my house.

Over the next few days I had a feeling that the experience had been profound, amazing and intense. I had tripped before, years ago but this seemed magnitudes more intense. After a couple of days though this feeling wore off. Its hard to explain but I did carry with me a feeling of being “whole”, sort of rooted in the universe and I feel more accepting of myself.

691,"So as my doctor didn’t even know of ketamine’s existence(wtf), i’m going to do the smart thing and get medical advice from strangers on the internet.

So I love taking ketaminr. I never took as much as i see a lot of people do (ranging from a few times a year to 2-4 times a month with an exception of a week of consuming 2 grams over the week.) 

So during and after that week I was noticing problems with my bladder and pain. Log story short; I was told that there had been 3 polyps growing in me for about 10 years And they were removed. No doubt the ketamine usage made me notice it because the symptoms worsened after prolonged use. Nothing crazy though. I know plenty of people who rail 1 gram in a line.

Anyway, it’s been over a year since my surgery And i still notice some dis omfort when i take ketamine without downing liters bladder&amp;kidney tea first. Also my bladder has weakened alot.  I have taken ketamine again a few times after a year. Last time i didn’t have the tea handy(with it i feel none at all) and i felt quite some discomfort. It scared me , to say the least.


Ketamine is my favorite drug but not worth losig my bladder over.


So... does anyone have any idea if i can continue using K every other month or so? Just one hole is fine instead of using al of the bag.

712,"Both here and on r/drugs I will see lots of studies that posit potential antidepressant and anti-anxiety like effects from CBD (NOT weed), MDMA, LSD, psilocybin and other drugs like it. They are often used in specific, non-general populations like those with PTSD, treatment resistant depression, autism, and so forth. Afflictions that set them apart from most people who use those drugs recreationally. 

The problem I have with these studies, as cool as they are, is the crowd of recreational users take to them as ""oh cool, so this drug I do five times week IS medicine after all!"". Like, people use anecdotes about how they aren't depressed because they smoke weed everyday and are high most of the time. 

It seems to me that many of these people are not in the populations being studied, but normal people looking to justify their drug use. On the NowThisWeed Facebook page, the few times the reference studies pointing to the negative effects of weed, everyone gets all up in arms and says the study is flawed or not valid. If a study shows CBD or THC having potential medical use, then suddenly the study is amazing and should be 100% trusted. 

Like, those who purport medical use of these drugs don't actually stand to benefit them and just want their drug use validated. Keep sharing those studies because they are cool, but I'm sick of people who smoke daily or microdose acting like niche population studies somehow ""prove"" anything about the drug's effectiveness for certain conditions.

720,"I couldn't find a separate subreddit for rapé, so posting it under aya.

I did something that I regret and feel really bad about and I can't tell if these feelings are sth real or some surfacing stuff meant to be let go.

I did my first rapé ceremony 5 days ago, administered by a European guy who's not a shaman, although a spiritual person (met him on a dating site, we quickly ended up at his place). 

Hard to tell what is the effect of what, but I started feeling attracted to him, rapé also brought up some deep stuff that's hard to verbalize (closest is extreme clingyness and desire to be held). 

I felt very strange afterwards, heavy, needed tons of sleep, ate unhealthy foods, etc etc. Had some low energy around me.

Yesterday we did it again. It was hard, and hard to describe. Again felt heavy, but also really unworthy and low. Took it out on the guy too, felt he was rude and bad to me (this part I'm not sure about).

Since I have no previous experience and little knowledge about rapé, I am quite worried:

- how important is it to do it in trustworthy company? (I just really hope it's not as prone to influence from the outside as ayahuasca ceremony)
- is it possible to be attacked by spirits during rapé ceremony?
- was it a bad idea to have sex? (from a spiritual point of view; it certainly was from my point of view, I felt so absolutely worthless)
- it's been 20 hours, but I'm still really anxious and low and feeling very much not ok, what can I do to protect and cleanse myself and return back to normal?

732,"First there was the cleanse, a twelve hour fast followed with drinking water from a volcanic spring. It was salty, all six glasses of it. Following the drinking came the watery diarrhea. Lasting only a hour or two, drinking the water until your fecal matter was clear. The rest of the day was returning to a light diet and zero trust of any fart. We were not to eat after midnight and would have no food until the following night after our first ceremony.

An hour drive out of Cusco into the heart of the Andes, somewhere in the Sacred Valley is a place that specializes in integrative medicine. Or basically Ayahuasca, a drink that people who have never taken it like to say makes you hallucinate.  There’s a psychologist and Doctor on scene, as well as a nurse and interpreter/coordinator. Let’s not forget the Andean Priest and the Shipibo Shaman.

My interest in Ayahuasca and DMT goes back a few years. I’ve read about the experiences people have had on it and dhow it has helped people with mental health issues and addictions. It piqued my curious mind and considering my own traumas, I had my fair share of mental health problems. So, after watching some parts unknown back in June I got the idea of going to Peru. After researching Peru, I saw the talk of people going into mountains and taking ayahuasca. The idea of going on a spirit journey nested itself deep inside my head. There were many options of places to go, but the one I went to was at the top of every search with soaring reviews.

The first day out there, after the drive, is more of an orientation. We do a small ceremony with the Andean priest, eating Coca leaves. We can only drink water or tea for the remainder of the day. The doctor takes our vital signs and goes over our medical history. She’s bilingual and attractive so I kind of want to marry her. There’s then a meeting with the psychologist. He’s a younger fellow, maybe late twenties.  We route out my goals, asking what problems I want to work on. I tell him my main issue has been maintaining any kind of relationship. After talking he suggests I work on becoming more vulnerable during my ceremony, I agree, I’m more often than not emotionally a brick wall.
	
At 1830 we meet outside our hut for a few prayers from the shaman and Andean priest. They are for cleansing the soul.  And even after the prayers I being to feel lighter.

By 1900 we are in the hut and the Ayahuasca is being passed out. Each dose measured and determined by the doctor and psychologist. The nurse and coordinator stay in the hut with us but do not partake, the Shaman does. He sits in the center of us, smoking a very natural and specific tobacco, all while chanting ikaros, a certain meditative prayer.

It takes about 30 minutes for the things to take effect. The expectation is to vomit once it starts. There’s a bucket near each us, ten total. We all have water and tissue as well. I hear a person in the tent vomit, then another.

I delve down deep and start to feel an overwhelming fear. The most I’ve ever felt, just absolute sheer terror. I turn to the bucket and vomit. I look at my hands and watch them become paws. I look in the bucket and staring back it me is a cougar with piercing red eyes. I remain terrified. I continue to vomit. More than anyone else in the hut. Well maybe, another guy, who had some seriously negative energy the second he joined us, had gone outside. I was not made to stay inside the hut. Walking on your own isn’t really an option as you begin to feel the vibrations of the world, I’m assisted out and feel better with the fresh air but still am purging. The other guy out there, for the longest time I’m not sure if he was real, until other people started to acknowledge him. He’s a white Romanian fellow, but all I could see around him was a dark aura, a cloud of bad energy. He keeps saying can you believe we paid for this. The nurse is next to me. She’s connected to the spirit world. I am certain of it. She’ s calm, caring and affectionate as I feel like a terrified child lost in the forest. While outside I see things every time I close my eyes. A woman with black hair introducing me into situations that would harm or kill me, like walking into a cage of rabid dogs, or being surrounded by wood chippers. Its me but its not me she’s trying to eliminate. There is a constant pull to do it, but the part of me she’s trying to kill has too much of hold on and keeps pulling back. I move to a chair and the nurse puts me in a sleeping bag and covers me in a blanket. I have no idea how much time has passed. It could have been ten minutes, it could have been ten days. I being to feel this warmth and overwhelming joy as I am shot up into the stars. I look around momentarily, my subconscious dumping and seeing things like me winning a basketball game (Which I’ve never done, unless it was a past life), being heroic in the line of duty, falling in love, etc. When it ceases I look down and see earth. I’m shot down plummeting like a comet into the heart of the jungle. I am the cougar. I am running. I am surrounding by dense green that is somewhat leafy but also patterned in sacred geometry. I just run, and I am happy. According to my friend who came down before, I had the biggest smile he has ever seen on me before and he’s correct.
 When the visions stop, I am assisted to the bathroom, as I haven’t used it. Some people get poopy, I thankfully did not. Then I am helped to the kitchen to eat a bowl of soup and bread. I’m barely hungry and my body is exhausted. It’s around midnight and everything still has its own vibration. I feel happier. Lighter.

The following morning, we go to give the energy back. Peru is very catholic. We got to the Mother Theresa orphanage in Cusco and help with the disabled children. It’s a bit overwhelming. We get back to the valley around 1300 and eat a piece of fruit then explain our experiences to the shaman, there is a second ceremony this night as well. The shaman says I was purging out all the toxins in my body, and said it wasn’t uncommon for it to happen. The doctor and psychologist and shaman all agree my dose should remain the same. Two people felt they got what they needed from the first ceremony but would join us in the hut and meditate per recommendation. They see visions again that night. The Romanian guy did not like what he saw. He left right away in the morning, and you could tell a cloud of bad voodoo had left.

The second ceremony starts at 1900. We have 6 hours to kill. I go on to talk to the psychologist and explain what happened. He says its possible that Pachamama was trying to get me to destroy one of my egos. He explains that people have two egos, a negative one and a positive one. My negative one can be very strong. I decide going in to bite off more than I can chew and ask Mother Ayahuasca to help me kill my negative self.

The remaining six hours I spend talking with other people going through the ceremony. Its often suggested that people spend the free time in silence and meditate, but our group, with the shady Romanian gone, was just clicking like we had known each other for years so we all went with it. We talk about our experiences, our past, what brought us here, a whole array of things. When the conversation runs its course, I go and draw for a bit. It’s nothing I’m very good at, I’m sure there’s a five-year-old better than me, but its something to focus on as I think about what I intend to accomplish with the night.

I forgot to mention the cleansing right before taking the ayahuasca. Its basically rubbing some water and dirt over your body for protection and then two other fragrant oils for the same reasons.

I drink my ayahuasca, it tastes like oil and dirt, and begin to focus on my goal. I ask for help and forgiveness, and guidance to destroy my negative self. By the time I start to vomit I start to regret what I asked for, because what follows for the next couple hours is pure terror. I go outside again. Different reasons this time. The energy I’m killing feels like it can spread throughout the hut. Everything tells me this is something I have to do alone. I can hear the ikaros inside the tent. I sit in the chair outside and begin feel like I’m dying and being pulled away, looking at my lifeless body, my ego Denys it and pulls me back down. Every time I shut my eyes I can feel myself getting pulled into two and my negative id has such a strong hold on me that it won’t let go. Every time that negative self refuses my body purges and out comes vomit. I vomit a lot. I drink four liters of water and it all comes back out. Sometimes the vomit is watery, at other times its foamy, and other times is black, sometimes I see the actual demons come out. I end up filling two buckets. Its hard to explain what was happening. Every part of me that would me back was getting purged. The excuse maker, the nay sayer, etc. Each time he prodded his head and refused to acknowledge my true self he was purged, and he kept showing up. But in time I was split right in two and I was looking back at my other half and watched as a snake struck time and time and time again until that version of me was dead. I am then pulled up again, into what I can only explain is a different dimension. There is a goddess there, she has three faces from what I can tell, but in this realm it could be one face and I just can’t interpret it. She shows me who I am. She tells me that everything I’ve ever done has led me to her. There is what looks like arithmetic in the sky that I can’t comprehend.  She tells me I always was meant to be a warrior and asked me to stay and help protect her. I decline, I have family back home, she is mad but understanding of my reasoning, and tells me I will have the opportunity again. The rest of the journey is me asking questions and kind of getting answers but I oddly cant remember any of the questions or answers, but they are probably deep in my subconscious. I’m the last one having visions. Everyone has gone inside to eat, I can hear there laughter in the distance as they talk about their experience. I feel like mine was quite different and way more intense. I almost fall asleep outside but make my way to the food, still not quite back, somewhere in the middle ground between here and there. I chat for a little bit and the others are looking at me in awe. Telling me how brave I was for going after something so big. I often don’t realize it, but that’s just who I am.

The next morning, we eat one hell of a breakfast. Some are remaining for a few more ceremonies, some aren’t. I only signed up for two. Once again, we talk with the shaman and doctors. I feel unburdened, lighter, happier. Everything that was clouding my life had been washed away I tell them about everything, the traumas in my life that had attached demons to me, from childhood, to war, to my current career. I tell them how I feel truly grateful which is not something I normally feel. I tell them I feel love, which is not something I normally feel. I tell them I feel unburdened, free. I tell them I feel like I could benefit by doing one or two more ceremonies, but I was on a timeline to get back to Lima. 

The rest of the trip was entertaining enough, traveling throughout the country, I began to feel the direct effects wearing off and didn’t really notice any change until I got home.

A lot of my cravings are gone. I don’t desire alcohol or red meat. I’ve been working out again quite regularly and just feel all around better. I’m not really identifying as an atheist anymore, there’s more out there and I have seen it. I also have kind of recognized what happens when we die. There’s not really heaven or hell. Just energy, and all the bad energy we carry gets shed away when we enter the next realm, which is good for some of us and not so good for others. I don’t feel one hundred percent corrected, but I have been given the tools to become a better person and that was the biggest takeaway from the experience. It wasn’t so much enjoyable, but it was therapeutic. I feel different yet the same. And I keep having some intense dreams, and the other night after waking I had some minor visions again. I probably sound like a crazy person, but I also haven’t felt this good ever in my memory.",Ayahuasca,A Journey into the Spirit World

735,"Hi everyone, first time poster here!

So, I have been planning a trip to a 3-night retreat in November for some time. This retreat includes ayahuasca, rapé, kambo, and psychotherapeutic services.

As the date nears, I'm beginning to feel more and more anxious about it. While I do have some issues that ayahuasca could help me open up to, there's another part of me that feels that I'm seeing ayahuasca as a sort of panacea, and that I'm spiritually bypassing.

I also have derealisation disorder and I'm afraid that ayahuasca might screw me up even more mentally. I have never heard anything of people leaving the ayahuasca with permanent mental illness, but it's still a concern for me.

I have heard of people experiencing a ''calling'' to ayahuasca, but I never really got said calling, or at least I don't think so. I've been interested in doing it for a few years to make some progress in unravelling my pathologies, but I never felt anything mystical pulling me toward ayahuasca.

It would be great if you guys could provide your opinions.

Thanks in advance!

I interviewed a lady recently who had an  **Ayahuasca**  experience that seems to run in line with the ""Stoned Ape Theory"" and here is the rough transcript of her audio.  What are your thoughts?

====================== 

We were in a group of 20 of us.  Five of us knew each other.  the rest were strangers.  We sat around on mats with the Shaman in the middle.  In front of the Shaman was their potions and perfumes and and a bottle of what appeared to be some dark red juice which was invariably the  **Ayahuasca** .  A small serving, perhaps 2 ounces or so per person was placed into a cup and handed to each participant who then threw it back.  The taste was like a smoked rancid barbecue sauce and the texture was thick and uncomfortable to swallow.  The taste hung around in one's mouth for some time.  After all had partaken the Shaman asked us to lay back on our mats as it would take around 20 minutes for the earliest participants to feel the effects begin to set in.  Each participant was given a pail and while we knew from our preparation and research that purging was a part of the process, we were unsure of exactly what that would look like.

As that 20 minutes had about come to pass, I suddenly heard a stranger across the room begin to heave into their pail.  Several hard heaves with it ending with the obvious expulsion of material.  While that marked the first it was certainly not the last person as one by one it seemed all present to one degree or another begin dry heaving or throwing up.  My first awareness before my own throwing up that the medicine was kicking in was that when my eyes were closed a moving kleidiscope of vibrant colors begin to be present in my mind as if seeing it with my own eyes.  but if I opened my eyes i was still fully in the structure.....

as if right before my eyes the structure began to change.  The room became more demonic and and the participants seemed to be spread apart.  I immediately feared for my life and sensed I was heading into a bad experience, the ones people warn you about.  The medicine will find your weakness and exploit it and it was doing that very thing with me.

For the next 45 minutes and what seemed to me as hours as time is distorted beyond comprehension, I experience what I can only call a combination of a medical emergency, an anxiety attack, a nightmare, and a living hell as I thought I was dying.

Finally the waves of anxiety and fear subsided and I was able to sit still for a few moments reflecting.  Suddenly I catch my self thinking I am a chimpanzee and making faces as a chimp.  Showing my teeth and sticking my lips out and making sad faces and happy faces and angry faces.  Suddenly I have this epiphany.  That under the medicine of Ayahuasca, I was able to tap into another state of awareness and consciousness.   I not only was that very monkey in the moment, but as I was thinking about the social order of my tribe of monkeys and why I and why we each do the things we do.    I watched as the Ayahuasca caused others in the room to make noises and then yet other to play off those noises with their own.  I sensed the why behind this tribal communication.  seeing through the eyes of a chimp and seeing the other particpants as other chimps within a tribe I saw the the need to belong and how each member of the tribe seeks to find and fill their place with the tribe.  The first thing that must clearly be understood is the Ayahuasca... the medicine as it is rightly called....  truly opens you up to a consciousness you can't otherwise tap into. If you have done it a few times, you will know this to be true and if you haven't you will likely resist allowing such to enter your mind.  But it truly does.  And everything I am going to share going forward hinges on accepting that as truth.

Suddenly this awareness of what the medicine does allows me to begin making the second connection.  Which is allowing myself to consider what would happen if our ancestors.  Those common ancestors of us and the apes, what would happen if they came across the medicine or another plant like it.  And out of the hundreds or even thousands of our ancestors who may have used such a plant, what if a few of them had a similar experience to what I was having.  Here they are just a primate.  living their life out of instinct and primal behavior and suddenly they have the experience of becoming aware of their awareness and the social cues and mechanisms behind their behaviors?  This would be a game changer.  This would be mind expanding.  They would be tapping into what it means to be human.  Consciousness.  recognizing you are an observer to the world and being aware of that observation taking place.  

If we start with the assumption that some of these plant medicines raise one to a more expansive consciousness then one can understand the following visionary experience and insights I had in using the medicine. 

In the ceremony I took part in there was music played by the facillitator.  When under the power of the medicine the music became the most incredible thing to listen to.  Here was a room full of people, each having their own mystical experience but somehow we also shared in the experience as well.  I, in this new consciousness, watched this room give social cues that they were enjoying the music.  I observed the social cues of these people reaching out in connection to others with sounds and movements.  I observed my own social cues as I connected with those I knew at this ceremony and those who were strangers but had somehow in this experience became my tribe.  

I asked myself, If my ancestors 100,000 years ago had found this medicine and as they used it on multiple occasions, what would have happened?  What makes sense that they would do with that.

1.\) Some among the group would have the same insight I had.  some would have recognized a higher consciousness available to them through plant medicines like psilocybin mushrooms or Ayahuasca.  This would have led to the need to convey this to the tribe.  To help the members of the tribe see the medicine as a tool and to help members of the tribe understand these insights, the wide elders \(male and female\) would have created myths around the medicine and ascribed rituals to convey those myths.  It struck me in my experience how natural it would have been to see something like Ayahuasca as an extraordinary breakthrough for our ancestors and how natural it would have been to then create myths and rituals around those myths to ensure that this medicine's extraordinary abilities are recognized, preserved, and shared generation to generation.  

2,\) Recognizing how healing such experiences could be they would have ascribed myth around potions, smoke, fire, perfumes and such to convey what one could be taught to expect from the experience with the medicine. 

3.\) Seeing how participants would receive blessing in their life from the medicine \( aka: insights that would benefit in real life application\), they would create ritual of touching and anointing with myth story connected to those actions in order to convey what one could expect to see as a result of this medicine.

4.\) Some of these medicines would, just as Ayahuasca does, invoke purging.  This purging is a side effect but also has so much symbolism and metaphor so as to be a tool unto itself.  I pictured in my minds eye how through out the year things would happen within a tribe.  anger, violence, loss, hurt, betrayal, and how having the tribe get together every 6 months or so and perform this rituals and using these medicines would give the tribe a chance to purge its past errors.  Imagine one of our ancestors killing a member of his tribe out of anger.  The tribe is hurt.  They feel loss.  They struggle to reconcile this.  Take the ancestor who carried out the act and his feeling shame and feeling as if he it outside the tribe.  Imagine the power when the tribe convenes to partake of the medicine.  Spitting perfumes in the air and waving sage and smoke over heads.  These rituals within a tribal gathering in the midst of tribal purging and tribal connection.... it would have provided a space for the tribe to forgive the wrong by one of its own.  to purge itself of those kinds of things and to validate and welcome all back as members of the tribe.  It would have allowed the tribe as an entity to move past serious wrongs.  It would have provided an outlet for the tribe to use hurtful experiences to bring the tribe closer.  It would have provided the mechanisms that allowed the tribe to co\-exist for generations as a cohesive unit.

5.\) once one medicine was found and insights received, it would have been understood as beneficial to seek after other medicines even at the risk of poisoning a few in order for the tribe collectively to find the next medicine that imparts deep insights.  The trial and error process would have been collectively a large net positive.   

6.\) This could easily when seen this way be an ingredient into human evolution.  That once a cohesive group of people are enlarging their consciousness and opening themselves up to insights otherwise unreachable, you can see how this would begin to deeply separate this group from other peoples who have no access to such plant medicines.

7.\) There is wisdom and function in recognizing that rituals and myths impart certain types of information better than simply trying to describe the information.  myth and ritual can if done right, provide a mystical experience that seems transcending to the initiated.   It also has the power to stay consistent for generation after generation allowing the power and insights to persevere through time. 

8.\) It would have imposed an increase in language. Having insights coming with regularity within a tribe at a pace unseen before would have quickly imposed a need for new words.  language within this tribe would have drastically shifted.  this tribes language would have changed in a way that within a few generations, other peoples using that same starting language may have struggled to understand the vocabulary and a disconnect could easily occur.

9.\) An deep and expansive tribal intuition would sprout and grow.  Empathy, loyalty, support, connectedness, all would develop in new and dynamic ways.  An appreciation for differences among genders, appearance, personality traits, perspectives would have grown out of such a tribal experience where on one hand the tribes is connecting in more full ways and at the same time each person is receiving their own unique sacred experience on the medicine different than every other person.

10.\)  This combination of purging along with a mystical experience can not be overvalued.  This created space to, as a community join together to both purge the past and the mistakes along with share with each other the insights and hopes going forward would have created something special among these peoples.

11.\) It would have been understood through trial and error that the risk/reward was much better when the tribe took the medicine together as a group versus an individual experience.  I quickly realized when I was alone on the medicine for a short moment or two through the night i felt despair and disconnect.  by creating a tribal gathering where with rituals the Shaman leads the group, these ancestors partaken together and such would ensure this remained a group experience.

12.\)  There would have been a time the following day just as we had in our experience with the medicine in which each member of the tribe could step forward and share their insights so all could make the new connections and feel what each has felt, in effect creating a tribal intelligence that is exponentially greater than each individual experience added together to sum total.

I sat there making my monkey faces wondering if medicines like this moved humans into Ethnocentricity for the first time?  Did it move them beyond such tribal boundaries?  Did it give them the ability to take the perspectives of their enemies.  did it help them take the perspectives of the animals and the plants?  How far could this new awareness reach?

All through the night I sat there looking through the eyes of a monkey and connecting with my ancestors in a way that allowed me to see their development from a distance.  To see what would necessitate the need for ritual to be created.  The need for a myth story to transfer information and how a myth would be created and imposed as a having literal meaning while really only being metaphors and symbols.  ==================================Thoughts?",Ayahuasca,"Interview with Ayahuasca user and her story compared to the ""Stoned Ape Theory"""

****

Methylphenidate (MPD; Ritalin/Concerta and d-MPD; Focalin) is the most commonly prescribed ADHD medication worldwide. It is considered to be highly effective for ADHD treatment.

However, one of the downsides of chronic MPD use is its abuse potential. Since MPD is a dopamine reuptake inhibitor (DRI), it also has rewarding/reinforcing effects, which can lead to addiction in predisposed individuals. The mechanism of action of Methylphenidate is similar to this of Cocaine, and accordingly, in high doses, they are reported to have similar subjective effects.

Modafinil is one of the most commonly used nootropic drugs, and it has 2 main mechanisms of action: Dopamine reuptake inhibition, as well as CNS Histamine receptor agonist activity. The subjective reported effects of Modafinil are in accordance with its mechanisms of action. Modafinil's DRI activity has previously raised a concern: Can it be addictive like other DRIs?

The paper above, from 2011, has found that while Modafinil is a DRI, it works differently compared to Cocaine-Like DRIs (MPD &amp; Cocaine). While MPD &amp; Cocaine bind the dopamine transporter (DAT) in such a way that reverses dopamine transport (thus releasing dopamine)^[[1]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0028390814002342?via%3Dihub)[[2]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3684841/) , Modafinil does not. In that sense, Modafinil is a ""pure"" DRI, while MPD &amp; Cocaine also induce dopamine release by reversing the direction of the DAT.

The lack of dopamine release with Modafinil might therefore mean a lack of rewarding/reinforcing effects (leading to a lower abuse potential), which are presumably apparent with MPD &amp; Cocaine due to their ability to release dopamine.

While this study was in vitro, it is possible that this could translate to lower abuse potential of Modafinil in vivo (rodents, and later possibly humans too), compared to this of MPD &amp; Cocaine.",DrugNerds,"Non-addictive ADHD treatment?

- I was able to see the world in a 2 dimensional (almost cartoonish) way. It was like everything fitted in perfectly well together, with no sensory overload whatsoever. I was able to intuitively feel how things were linked, which might have been the first time I experienced this.
- I became aware of my neurosis (what I would also call my sense of self), whom continuously was coming up to disturb my inner peace. I was able to see compassion for this neurosis, where it was coming from, and that it was here to help. I learned to see it in a different way. Now some weeks afterwards I am much more capable of recognising my neurosis and just accepting it, henceforth letting it disappear.

So recently while discussing this on r/stims I found this little paper: https://sci-hub.tw/http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/1997/an/a700122c

&gt;Unfortunately, and contrary to the majority of chiral
substances,13 some salts of amine drugs, including methamphetamine,
do not form racemic crystals. Instead, a mechanical
mixture (or conglomerate sample) results in which an equimolecular
mixture of enantiomeric crystals of the two isomers is
present. 

2nd paragraph of intro right there. 

Sadly, though, this quote is not in turn cited to some other resource. 

This would seem to confirm my argument that individual crystals of meth will contain only one isomer per, either d- or l-, never a mix of both. However, this does not mean that you cannot nonetheless have a mixture of enantiopure crystals of either isomer. 

When I brought this up to the person I was conversing with, u/Deivawithflames, a mod of r/stims, she brought up this article here as a counterpoint: 

https://bcachemistry.wordpress.com/2014/05/25/methamphetamine-crystal-clear-chemistry/

But as I pointed out, this article, if you read closely, also seems to confirm my theory: 

&gt;If the product is impure and thus contains both enantiomers, then it will crystallized into what is known as a quasiracemate, the mixture of two similar but directionally distinct compounds. Typically, when the product is pure, it will crystallize into a racemic conglomerate. This is where molecules in the structure have a strong attraction to the same enantiomer, rather than the opposite one.

What's confusing here is the definition of ""conglomerate"" among other things. After a bit of research, I have come to the conclusion that a conglomerate is a mixture of crystals, each of which contains only one isomer. Check this out as proof: https://goldbook.iupac.org/html/R/R05028.html

Please let me know what you think here especially. The language in the source is not exactly ""crystal"" clear (sorry, bad pun ;-)

I thought I would bring this to you all here to get some more input on the issue, and hopefully some more research going one way or the other. What I really care about is finding the truth, much more than whether my own theory happens to be correct.

776,"Pre-aya, I use to be incredibly docile and overly empathetic. I was nice to a fault. I don't think it's due purely to meekness, I just feel pain all the time and can't fathom making others feel that way, even if I felt it was deserved. But I was overpolite, would rarely cause problems and tried to be happy. I just felt I didnt give a shit most of the time, and resistance to the situation was just bothersome...even if I probably should've stood up for myself more.

A small, minor lesson (or seemingly so at the time) was that it's ok to be selfish sometimes.

Lately (about 5 months after my ceremonies), I have a large amount of anger coming out. At the way people treat me, talk to me, etc. I am still pretty level head and not irrationally angry (I hope), but it's anger that is somewhat explainable.

I wonder, is this progress? I am not used to anger being directed outwards, and am not too familiar in dealing with this emotion. One of my biggest intentions was a better connection with my body and mind, and to fully feel my emotions(been numb from depression for most of my life)....well I feel this. It's obviously not super desirable to have easy triggers for anger, but do you think this could be progress? I know it's counter to the typical aya message of love, but I feel long term I need to know how to deal with this emotion, and this is a step in that direction. I also now think its worth the trouble to stand up for myself. Sometimes I want people to lash out a bit at me, to see how I react...its a bit fucked haha.

777,"I drank ayahuasca couple of months ago. Now I wonder if the experience was created by my mind. I did not have any visions or sort. What it felt like was I was travelling in different worlds.

First day I was in outer worlds, from one world to another meeting these advanced beings (technologically and spiritually) who filled me with knowledge and told me that I can travel their world again, it was like they gave me a pass to their world. I dont understand now what knowledge it was and what that pass is supposed to mean. Also many of the beings I met did not know about earth, earth seemed like a very primitive planet compared to theirs. Few were aware that I had drank plant to travel which was primitive way for them as they could travel (with their knowledge and technology) I suppose. Few knew about earth and I felt like they were feeling funny about it. I also met a fellow traveller being who knew about Buddha, I dont remember any faces but I remember this fellow traveller had a suit (sort of travelling suit) which also had (seemed) a bag-pack attached to the suit. We chatted for a while before he had to leave to his home planet I suppose. There also was this station for travellers and it felt like it was familiar among other travellers too, it had a name and I was sure that other people  know about this place as well.

I made friends in those worlds and few asked me to show something from earth. There wasn't anything I could think of that they would find interesting. I showed them the snake game from Nokia (idk why). I dont know how I showed them but they understood the game and they were playing it, idk how (telepathically in their heads maybe). The game was too simple for them so they made it more advanced. They named the game after me, which I found funny. After travelling more in these worlds and when the trip was mostly over I got up to go to shit and realised that walking was very difficult. I felt like I had travelled in time and space and my body was tired because of that. I managed to walk slowly, tho it was dizzy and my body felt weak. Now after months I wonder if I was just lucid dreaming ? About not seeing any visions, my shaman said then that, it could have been blocked due to my impurity (toxins he meant, i suppose)

I was to take ayahuasca second time after a day or two during which I drank other medicines (plants). When I took ayahuasca, this time I was travelling in something like animal plane. The world felt smaller than the first(outer world) It felt like I was meeting snake beings and other animals. In the beginning I was scared but later I realized that there was nothing to be afraid of, they were my friends. There were three snake beings with whom I was travelling with and they even had name (or idk if my mind gave them the names). I did not have visions then too. . During these I puked a little.

After two more days of other medicines I took ayahuasca the third time. And during this time I was travelling with the ancestors of that village. They showed me the village and I was welcomed by them. They called me a small shaman. My shaman was resting and I was guiding myself(i think). The shaman's aunt (old lady) who was lives nearby revealed herself as the healing mother. She had been observing me without my knowing all this time I stayed in their village. She knew me inside out tho we had not spoken more than few words because of language barrier. But in the trip she loved me and took care of me. I was filled with love. It felt like she was working on my body.

I stayed in that community for about a week and drank three times along with other plants.

I read about people's experience telling about the visions and stripping off their ego and I wonder if my ego was too strong or if I should have drank more ayahuasca. Could it all be my mind's excuse to protect itself and instead took me on a trip ? Till now idk what that knowledge and what that pass was about but the intensity of the trip is fading away slowly.

798,"**Mechanisms of NMDAr antagonist Neurotoxicity**

According to the classic model, acute NMDAr antagonist neurotoxicity is a byproduct of blocking NMDAr's on GABAergic interneurons which inhibit pyramidal cells in the posterior cingulate and retrosplenial cortices. Injection of muscarinic ACh antagonist scopolamine or AMPA antagonist NBQX into the cortex precludes this neurotoxicity, exhibiting that excessive and simultaneous release of Glu+ACh onto cortical neurons is the neurotoxic mechanism.

Another potential neurotoxic mechanism, which may be more relevant to recreational use, is the possibility for upregulation of NMDAr's leading to possible excitotoxicity when the ligand blockade of NMDAr channels is ceased \[ref's: [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29747570), [2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20080153), [3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25245072), [4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15857702), [5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21886601), [6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23065140), [7](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25937004), [8](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22015741), [9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20691775), [10](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12711354), [11](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10871324), [12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10029241)\]. Keep in mind that GluN1 (also known as NR1) subunits are obligatory for forming an NMDAr; while GluN2A (NR2A) &amp; GluN2B (NR2B) preferentially lead to cell survival and apoptosis cascades, respectively. In addition, it's worth noting one study where downregulation was demonstrated after 5-6 weeks of sub-anesthetic ketamine \[[13](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27796754)\], possibly as a result of increased Glu efflux \[[14](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6098048/)\].

***Bacopa Monnieri***

*Bacopa Monnieri* (BM) is available as a nootropic and is commonly marketed as a memory-enhancer due to, for example, a study showing statistically significant improvements in medical students. Generally it is said to take at least one month to notice effects and there has been a number of anecdotes that it resulted in lethargy and/or apathy.

40-120mg/kg BM showed antipsychotic tendencies in ketamice due to modulatory effects on dopamine, serotonin, &amp; Glu \[[15](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25856700)\]. 200mg/kg of the BM extract CDRI-08 restored learning+memory in scopolamine-treated mice through GluN2B upregulation \[[16](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4564605/)\], while 50 or 100 mg/kg of CDRI-08 enhanced spatial memory in STZ-DM2 mice and this was correlated with upregulation of AMPA receptor GluR2 in the hippocampus \[[17](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26161865)\]. 300mg of BM for 15 days in epilepsy-induced rats was able to restore GluN1 expression and Glu receptor binding alterations to near-control levels \[[18](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18086456/)\].

Vesicular Glu transporters 1 &amp; 2 (VGLUT1/2) are analogous to VMAT2 while vesicular Glu transporter 3 (VGLUT3) moves Glu into the cell. Low levels of these transporters are associated with PCP-induced cognitive deficit and BM was able to return them to normal levels \[[19](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23745319), [20](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26387382), [21](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27562725)\]

PCP elicited GluN1 up-regulation in CA2/3 and DG. BM before PCP administration reversed this cognitive deficit by decreasing GluN1 in these brain areas \[[22](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25518293), [23](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23936991)\].

Sub-chronic PCP-induced deficits in novel-object recognition occurred alongside an increase in neuronal density in striatum, CA1 and CA2/3, however, it is statistically significant only in CA1. It's important to note that if PCP is upregulating glutamatergic neurons then this neurogenesis would be deleterious. PCP+BM decreased neuronal density in the PFC, striatum, and CA1, though it is significant only in CA1. Is this recovery of cognitive function achieved by reducing glutamatergic neurons in CA1? There was a significant increase of neuronal density in CA2/3 in PCP+BM, this is in agreement with studies concluding that BM could improve memory tasks and affect neurogenesis. \[[PDF](https://www.docdroid.net/wat6vyS/6281-21518-1-pb.pdf)\]

BM is an antioxidant, so it may also be able to prevent neurotoxicity from NMDAr antagonist excessive free radical production \[[24](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161813X06002932?via%3Dihub)\].

Due to the gestalt of BM modulating NMDAr subunits in one direction while its isolated extracts regulate them in the opposite direction, it can be viewed in one functional regard as a rheostat of glutamatergic inputs.

**Tolerance to NMDAr antagonists**

Tolerance to NMDAr antagonists has become something of an enigma, due to it's seemingly non-dissipative nature. NMDAr upregulation certainly plays a role; it has been shown that acutely this is due to increased receptor trafficking from the endoplasmic reticulum, while with sub-chronic use it's due to increased protein synthesis \[[25](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17995927)\]. Alterations in NMDAr subunit stoichiometry \[[26](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12123679)\] or differential regulation of subunit expression \[[27](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11169168)\] may play a role as well. Upon cessation and clearance of active metabolites, it is likely that NMDAr downregulation will begin at some point thereafter to achieve homeostasis \[[28](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17401537)\]. Through reduction of GluN1 subunits, Bacopa monnieri could potentially modulate tolerance to NMDAr antagonists.

**Personal Experience**

After using an NMDA antagonist, generally a few days later (in association with metabolites clearing my system) I start experiencing a variety of symptoms that I have come to associate with NMDAr upregulation and hence excessive activation of NMDAr's. These include: sensitivity to light &amp; noise, brow tightness, a clicking sound that seems to come from somewhere in my head, mild narcolepsy, along with a general feeling of unease and scatterbrain. Caffeine tends to make them worse and noopept (positive allosteric modulator of AMPAr) did as well the time I tried it. They will generally be at their worst for a few days, if that, and then begin to subside and before long I feel normal.

I had taken some 3-MeO-PCE about 4-5 days ago and yesterday I started getting some of these symptoms, had some caffeine which made it worse and eventually decided to try a 500mg capsule of BM. I'm aware of how powerful the placebo effect can be, but within an hour - no racing thoughts, clicking noise in head gone, tightness in head gone, totally calm - I was feeling like my normal self. I also woke up this morning at about 4 AM from a very vivid dream which is really unusual for me. Studied biochemistry for an hour, ate some breakfast and then wrote this post, feeling really clear-headed and I'm a bit shocked that I was able to organize this out.  Feeling some tightness in my head coming on so I'm probably going to take another soon and see what happens, the only downside is it seems to upset my stomach a bit but I did take it on an empty stomach.

**TL;DR** *Bacopa monnieri* could prevent NMDAr excitotoxicity &amp; possibly reduce tolerance due to dissociative use by down regulating the GluN1 subunit of the NMDAr.",DrugNerds,Bacopa Monnieri: A potential adjunct for mitigating recreative NMDAr antagonist neurotoxicity.
799,"In my last post on here I discussed experimenting with what I thought were corn poppies (papaver rhoeas), but it turns out what I was experimenting with were long headed poppies. 

I’ve read some academic journals on the alkaloid profile of papaver dubium, and most cultivars have very small amounts of rhoeadine, and presumably isorhoeadine and rhoeaic acid. 

Today I hot knived some dried long headed poppy latex and about 20 minutes to half an hour later felt heavily, heavily sedated. I was in mild opiate withdrawals this morning and now feel totally fine. My pupils are like pinpricks, my stomach has settled, my eyes have dried up and my goddamned runny nose has stopped running too. I don’t think there’s a whole lot of recreational value to this, but it definitely feels good to not be in opiate withdrawals, and for my body to be working properly again. 

In terms of how the high feels subjectively, I’d say it feels almost like I’ve popped a couple of valiums but without the weird kind of spaciness that benzos give you. It’s super clear headed, and despite feeling super heavily sedated I’ve still managed to work consistently and without hiccups all day. I’ve finished up work and am just playing vidya in between typing this out. Woke up from a nap about an hour ago and could definitely fall back asleep, but don’t have to fight the urge to do so.

810,"I have been struggling with social anxiety and depression for years now, and I really want this to come to an end. I've tried other psychedelics before, and I feel I have learned valuable lessons from them, but they never cured my depression or anything like that. I still find myself feeling sad about life a lot. So recently I decided to book an Ayahuasca retreat in Peru, seeing as this has helped a lot of people.

Now, before making this decision, I had started an antidepressant (Prozac) for only a week, but then stopped since I knew I couldn't be on an SSRI at the time of doing an ayahuasca ceremony. As the time of the retreat approaches, I find myself having doubts.

Although Ayahuasca has helped a lot of people, I know that it has also hurt a lot of people. I've read some stories of people who had terrible experiences, and came back more messed up than they were before the retreat.  And then I've read other stories about people whom Ayahuasca didn't help at all. I can't help but feel like I'm gambling my time, money, and mental state on all of this, when I don't even know what the outcome is going to be.

I understand that Ayahuasca isn't a miracle cure. I know it is only supposed to help me see the things I need to do in order to heal myself. The reason I have chosen Ayahuasca over continuing the SSRI, is because I want something I can do once (I'll be drinking Ayahuasca three times during this retreat), that will help me for the rest of my life, instead of taking some pill every day for the rest of my life. If Ayahuasca can do that, then that will be great! I just worry that it won't.

What if I go to Peru, participate in the three Ayahuasca ceremonies, and then I come back only to find that nothing has changed? At that point I'll probably just go back on the SSRI. If that's the case, then it would be such a shame to waste all this money and time on this for nothing. I really don't know what the right decision here is. Maybe I should just go on the SSRI again, and only consider Ayahuasca as an absolute last resort. But at the same time, if Ayahuasca truly does have a lifelong positive effect on me, then this is definitely the route I want to choose. The uncertainty of the whole thing is killing me.

Aya seemed to do a hard reset on all my systems, and I feel more in touch with every part of myself than I ever have. For the most part I feel like I am 20 again, and have connections to the physical world I never had. This seems to include a crazy high sex drive. Before I went, it was hit or miss, what I would consider probably average for a guy my age (well north of 40). Now it seems to be like I am a teenager again. My question is, has anyone ever heard of Aya triggering this kind of physical response, or could it just be a product of clearing out long standing mental blocks that I didn't know existed? Overall I feel happier, more connected, and at piece then I have ever been (Google has been less than helpful on figuring this out probably because there is no research) I am just curious if anyone has heard of or had any experience along these lines.

Sync (2000):

\*\*Quote:\*\*The  shaman once more became the black jaguar and said ""but that’s so easy,  and the tea is so pure it probably won’t make me purge”

This  is based on Sync's old filtering process from the year 2000, nausea  free to the stomach and intestines brew. I learned it from Sync and have  dreamed moderate &amp; intensely strong brews over 55 times without  purging, but if you need to you will. And no, there are no actives that  get caught up in the black colored cotton sediment, all the actives are  water soluble and end up in the final tea, none of the magic is left  behind.

Rabbit said 5/29/16:

\*\*Quote:\*\*My  rabbit thanks you for this immensely! He never seemed to be able to get  that last bit of 'mud' out from the tea, and always suffered from  intense nausea during the experience. Didn't think the residue had  anything to do with it. The cotton ball in the funnel not only removed  that, but also resulted in -zero- nausea for him!

Thanks so much!!

Examine  where the leaf is from: are the chacruna leaves from Peru or South  America? I've never had any luck with any South American psychotria in  dreams, it's just too weak, you would be better off with Hawaiian  psychotria if you can find it, never fails to impress for a 3 hour  moderate to strong journey in dreams. 30 to 35 grams should be just  fine, often much less than that. Best thing to do is brew say 240 grams  of it and divide it into 8 x 30 gram doses, and depending on how strong  or weak the 1st dose is, you can add or subtact from the other portions  in the future when adding it to your caapi to get it just right.  Psychotria is dreamed by the UDV, Santo Daime, and Shuar Indian, and  Benny Shanon \[author of 'Antipodes of the Mind'\]...very traditional and  safe.

Always brew 1st (30 minutes is plenty on high heat if you  1st chop down the leaf into tiny pieces in a blender, no added acid or  vit c of any kind is needed), then filter the leaf out of the liquid  with (1) wire basket, (2) coffee cone made of fine wires, ending  filtering with a (3) cotton ball stuffed in a funnel...then you reduce  down the liquid at the end to around 16oz if you began with 240g of  leaf. That way, each of the individual 30g doses constitutes 2oz total.

Details  on filtering: Filter the psychotria liquid thru a (1) wire strainer,  then a (2) coffee cone basket made out of fine wires, and then thru a  (3) cotton ball in a large clean funnel to make it sediment free which  reduces or eliminates nausea to the intestines...have two of these  funnels with a cotton ball stuffed in them sitting in a large tall jar  sitting side by side so that you can pour off liquid from funnel into  adjacent ""funnel in a jar"" to continue filtering once the 1st jar's  cotton clogs up or slows down the flow too much, continue pouring off  the funnel's contents back and forth changing out the cotton when or if  it clogs.

With this method there is no throw up early in  dreams/no intestinal nausea. This does not of course eliminate nausea in  the brain which can result from dreaming too much leaf (too strong).  This was learned from Sync and Meteor back in the day who used hand  vacuum pumps to filter, but a cotton ball in a funnel is much quicker  and easier and works just as well.

The same method works for  filtering caapi. If you don't have the time or energy for caapi  shredding and boiling, there are hundreds of different caapi extracts  out there as well that can be dreamed in place. Caapi is more stable in  it's alkaloid content which does not vary from morning to night like  psychotria -- which can vary a bit depending on what time of the day it  is picked (morning is best).",Ayahuasca,Black Jaguar Ayahuasca brewing

851,"*This is intended to be a FAQ for people who wanna get some basic information about Ayahuasca. If you have any suggestions and ideas that can be added to improve this FAQ, please post them below!*

**Basic information about Ayahuasca**

***What is Ayahuasca?***

Ayahuasca is a psychoactive brew that contains [MAO-I's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoamine_oxidase_inhibitor) and the psychedelic substance [DMT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N,N-Dimethyltryptamine). It is used by the shamans and healers of the Amazon since thousands of years to treat various physical and mental illnesses, to gain insights about life and the nature of existence or to communicate with the spirit world by inducing a psychedelic trance that lasts several hours.

Within the last few years the brew has become more and more popular in the west and many people travel to the Amazon to find healing and insights.

***What can Ayahuasca heal and what not?***

Ayahuasca has the potential to heal various mental and physical illnesses, but not all. There have been studies in the recent years that suggest that psychedelics like Ayahuasca, LSD or Magic Mushrooms can help with anxiety, depression, drug addiction, PTSD and other mental illnesses and are much more effective than psychotherapy or psycho-pharmaceutical drugs when they are taken in the right setting. However, psychedelics should be avoided if you are suffering from schizophrenia or bipolar disorder.

For more specific information you can make a post in this subreddit.

***What effects will Ayahuasca have on me when I consume it?***

That depends. The effects that Ayahuasca can have reach from painful and terrifying to mystical experiences where time, space and ones own identity are transcended and absolute bliss is experienced. It also depends on the setting in which Ayahuasca is consumed, as well as the physical and emotional condition of the person that consumes Ayahuasca.

In many cases Ayahuasca causes vomiting, sweating and/or diarrhea in order to cleanse people from physical toxins and emotional baggage. The consciousness altering effects kick in about 20-60 minutes after the tea has been consumed and emotionally charged visions are often experienced. Many people report that they have let go of fear, anger or trauma after the plant helped them to face these issues.

***Where can I find a reliable retreat/shaman?***

You can look at these websites for ratings and reviews of various places that offer Ayahuasca in a ceremonial and/or therapeutic setting all around the world:

http://ayaadvisors.org/

https://www.ayamundo.com/

***Is there anything that I should be aware of before consuming Ayahuasca?***

Yes! Ayahuasca contains [MAO-I's (Monoamin Oxidase Inhibitors)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoamine_oxidase_inhibitor), which can be toxic to various degrees if you combine them with certain foods, drugs or medication. You definitely should avoid taking Ayahuasca in combination with anti-depressants like SSRI, which could lead to a dangerous and possibly fatal serotonin syndrome.

For more information on what foods and drugs to avoid, check out the following link: 

http://www.ayahuasca.com/science/what-foods-and-drugs-need-to-be-avoided/

If you take medication, please take a look at your patient information leaflet or ask your doctor if you can combine the medication with MAO-I's!

***Anything else that I need to know about working with Ayahuasca?***

Ayahuasca isn't a recreational drug. It is serious work that sometimes can be difficult and even painful &amp; terrifying. It is recommended to consume Ayahuasca under supervision of an experienced healer who you trust, because he or she can guide you through the trip and offer help if something unexpected or overwhelming happens.

Also keep in mind that Ayahuasca is not a magic cure and although it can produce astonishing results for some people, your healing process might take time, maybe even years, depending on your condition.",Ayahuasca,Ayahuasca FAQ

854,"I’ve always been really intrigued by this concept of “flashbacks”. As the common story I heard over and over in health class and in highschool urban legends, supposedly, if you take psychedelics there is a chance of spontaneously being transported to that state of mind at some point in the future. I’ve looked for scientific reports and documentaries about this supposed phenomenon in the past and have never been able to find anything.

I participated in my first three ayahuasca ceremonies about 6 months ago and although it was the heaviest/most difficult experience of my life, it was very worthwhile and, so far I believe, it was beneficial. I think I’ve employed a half decent system of integration and seem to be growing in some ways I was hoping to.

I have experienced some instances that I feel may be what people have been referring to when talking about flashbacks. It’s not as if I am hallucinating and experiencing the same sensations, but I seem to, seemingly out of no where, get reminded of any of the three very intense ceremonies and I seem to have the same *feelings* as I did during the ceremonies and get confronted with these same topics I set my intention on. Sometimes I just have to put my hand to my head as I remember the heaviness of it and say to myself “oh my god...wow”. This isn’t always disruptive though. Most of the time im left with an empowered and energetic feeling. Almost as if I was admiring a trophy I won in the past. 

I can imagine, though, if the correct amount of integration isn’t present, these experiences can be worrisome and disruptive to your life.

Has anyone else experienced this? Whatcha think?

**edit: found a good article about it. Seems like a lot of you are right, what I’m describing isn’t quite flashbacks, or HPPD**

I had a question about something that worried me a bit, last night i was in Lima at a salsa club, not drinking or anything just meeting up some old friends. And i got into a deep conversation with this awesome dude about ayahuasca and his experience, general info, etc. Only thing that came up was i mentioned i am a bit nervous going straight into my first ceremony on friday, the reason being that i am working (on my laptop) hardcore before my trip. I have to get all my work set-up and out of the way for when i am gone, because of this i have no time to really rest or get my mind ""in the right"" place. I will go straight from working to having maybe a full day on Friday to really prep. He was saying i should sit out the first ceremony and wait until monday to partake, to get my mind in the right place, really rest before hand, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

How important do you guys think this is? Will it really mess with the experience if i come from a stressed place the previous day?

858,"
I wish to present a novel, or at least uncommon, interpretation of the DMT experience as it relates to our current empirical understandings of consciousness and our observations of physical reality. 

The summary of my interpretation: I believe the DMT experience provides a glimpse of what it would be like to exist as a being whose consciousness is wired to accept a very different combination and prioritization of inputs from its neural structure than the beings we know of in our world. DMT temporarily causes a configuration of synaptic/neural activation that has no practical use (note that I’m talking about the experience itself, not the reintegration afterward, which could be potentially useful) to humans or other beings of earth, but may have practical use to beings that exist in a reality with a different configuration, different rules, and different residents. One possible metaphysical implication is that the experience of this configuration should show one of the possible realms where such a configuration would actually be used, if such realms were to exist somewhere in time and space. However, even without such a metaphysical belief, the “simulation hypothesis” I wish to present should hold as viable.

We already know from experiments with psychedelics that psychedelics result in more of the brain activating at once. Google something with the terms “psychedelic” and “brain scan” and you’ll find many studies showing psychedelics are associated with parts of the brain not normally activating together activating, creating more simultaneous connections than is possible in the typical sober, waking state (meditation may provide exceptions, as does REM sleep). The conscious experience on psychedelics, therefore, is an abnormal state unsuited to day-to-day living, but at the same time, one that involves the activation of multiple brain regions that have normal purposes: language processing, image simulation and visualization, memory stores, auditory processing, emotional processing, social processing, etc. On lower doses of different psychedelics, e.g., LSD, psilocybin, mescaline, the brain isn’t so activated so much that sensory input is shut out; in fact, the psychedelic state seems to amplify some aspects of sensory input and make them seem more important, such as with music or poignant sights. When activated beyond a certain threshold, however, with high doses of the above drugs, or a breakthrough dose of DMT, different parts of the brain appear to become activated to the extent that outside sensory input starts to become drowned out. Not only that, aspects of one’s day-to-day personality and thinking and memories also become drowned out, leading to the phenomenon known as “ego death”: the simulations provided by the visual, reasoning, and other relevant centers of the brain become so strong and chaotic that the consciousness seems to inhabit a space of mostly imagination that combines memories and experiences with completely fantastical simulations and produces delirious interpretations that the sober mind could not make, since the brain-state at this point is so far removed from the normal sober brain-state. 

There is no confirmed experimental evidence of this, but I posit with reasonably high confidence that the breakthrough DMT dose comprises one of the strongest versions of this simultaneous over-activation of multiple brain regions, far beyond the point that our consciousness has evolutionary reason to be able to deal with. 

This is where the possible metaphysical interpretations come in: many people who have experienced a breakthrough dose believe that their consciousness becomes transported to another dimension, a divine one with higher-order intelligences and entities. But rather than transportation, I personally believe that what is happening is an effective simulation of existing in a realm where such simultaneous activation of multiple brain regions, or neural networks, could actually be useful and a part of their existence. If such a realm were to exist, then the entities that exist that use such a higher order of neural networks simultaneously would appear as they do within the DMT breakthrough experience. 

One potential metaphysical belief relating to this is that all possible configurations of matter exist. That is, if a configuration can be imagined to hold within certain consistent physical laws, then it does exist somewhere in time and space. If all such realities exist, then beings with neural configurations reached by humans vaporizing or injecting DMT might exist, just somewhere else in time and space, probably outside our observable universe. This is precisely what the DMT experience would give us a glimpse of: what it’s like to exist as such a being with such a neural configuration leading to such a consciousness. The experience of having been there before might be an illusion: perhaps such beings constantly feel as if they are home with such a configuration. 

Another potential metaphysical belief is that such realms do not or cannot exist outside of our temporary experiences thereof, but the temporary conscious simulation of such a realm is still clearly possible, since it happens with DMT breakthroughs. I cannot say whether it’s more likely that such realms do or do not exist.

The particular version each person experiences on DMT should be distinct and personalized to the quirks of their brains: some people who lack the brain structures that associated with the feeling of déjà vu wouldn’t experience such a feeling in a DMT breakthrough, and therefore would be simulating an entity that exists without such feelings. Furthermore, the experience would be personalized in time according to which brain regions have been recently prioritized or not prioritized: since serotonin receptors seem to be upregulated or downregulated in response to certain things, any particular instance of a DMT breakthrough might activate the brain differently, leading to potential variations such as “hyperslaps” (bad DMT trips, perhaps involving more receptors being activated in negative parts of the brain), “shut-outs” (inability to break through, perhaps involving not enough or too many receptors being available for activation via DMT at a certain time), or different manifestations of different entities and spaces. 

The aftereffects of the DMT experience, which involves a deluge of connections that our normal conscious minds seem underequipped to interpret, might not be as related to the experience of temporarily residing in this conscious space as people seem to believe. Rather than downloading divine knowledge, one might expect the particular configuration of synaptic activation to provide a scrambling of priorities allowing for different perspectives to be more easily reached immediately following the trip, the same way it seems to work with other psychedelics. Furthermore, some new positive interpretations that comprised a fragment of the over-activated experience might be remembered and kept as positive lessons for future thought. My point is that the potential benefits to regular existence derived from such an experience comes less from the totality of temporarily existing as a higher-order entity might, and more from the some of the specific connections within the many simultaneous connections made that comprise that experience. That’s not to say the actual breakthrough experience is any less awe-inspiring, special, or interesting, but simply that we don’t need to invoke divinity or spirituality to explain the experience or benefits.

I've basically been highly stimulated for 2-3 years. 

One day I took some pre-workout and ran a 5K at the gym and pushed myself really hard for a personal best time - followed by a very intense session in the sauna for 1-2 hours (would not suggest this). 

Afterwards I had a strong sense of paresthesia in the right side of my head/brain and a very strong sense of anxiety. In the following weeks I had 4 or 5 full blown panic attacks and a high baseline anxious state. This was 3 months ago.  

I have stopped the stimulants. But this anxiety has stayed with me for 3 months now. It is progressively getting better, but I'm surprised given that it has been 3 full months - and the sense of paresthesia is still somewhat there.

I’m really attracted to ayahuasca for some reason, I heard someone mention it in a TV show a few months ago and since then I can’t stop doing research and I can’t get it out of my head. I guess my question is, would it be too much for someone who’s never really experienced a hallucinogen before? I suffer from anxiety but not nearly as bad as I used to. I have some things from my past I can’t seem to let go of and think Ayahuasca would be a great tool to help me do that and to kind of start new and expand my mind. But I’m also way terrified of the idea. Any advice is welcome and appreciated! ",Ayahuasca,Is Ayahuasca right for me?
878,"A Phase II clinical trial is starting this month (August 2018) in Brazil, through the University of Sao Paolo through Rafael dos Santos, to look at Ibogaine's efficacy for treating alcoholism.

It says that the trial is not yet recruiting in the link, below, but presumably then it will be soon.

Previous, similar trials were conducted in the U.S. but stopped in 1994, where it has been a Schedule I drug since the 60's, citing concerns about cardiotoxicity. However, there are numerous, numerous reports of Ibogaine being used to help people with wish to stop many different substances and ""legal grey zone clinics"" run in Mexico, Canada, the Netherlands, Costa Rica, New Zealand (where it's legal with prescription), Gabon, Guatemala (where it's legal for treatment in a center), and South Africa, where Ibogaine is unscheduled.

Brazil may be on track to legalizing Ibogaine treatment clinics for alcoholism if these trials progress:

Context:  21 year old male. My only experience with drugs prior to this is weed  and a low dose of LSD (1/3rd of a tab). I took the ayahuasca sandwich by myself in my room (bad idea I know). I was with a friend over Discord throughout the experience. He helped me log my experiences. Some of the time listed below are only rough  estimates.

0:00 &gt; I consume 3 grams syrian rue. Chewed in my mouth and swallowed with water. Tasted very bitter.

0:30  &gt;Consumed the ayahuasca sandwich. 3 grams of acacia confusa root  bark, wheat bread, peanut butter, strawberry jelly. Some bites I tasted  the bark, which tasted very bad. Like sawdust with a plastic smell.  However, mostly tasted like a normal pb&amp;j sandwich.

0:40  &gt; Room begins to shake back and forth. Hear a high pitch humming  noise at the back of my head that will stay with me until ego death. I  was surprised on how fast the effects appeared. I am calm. Slight  anxiety but feel ok.

1:00-1:30 &gt; My  sense of time starts to slowly warp. Visual effects increase in  intensity. I see streaks of light and objects in my vision begin to  warp. More intense shaking in my vision. I start to feel the body high.  Anxiety is steadily increasing. I begin to feel that something’s not  right. Like I was “sick”.

1:30? - 1:45?   &gt; I start to have nausea. I throw up. I felt good after throwing up.  All the anxiety went away and I didn’t feel sick anymore.

1:45  - 2:00 &gt; I begin to see faces in random objects. The faces were  creepy and made me uncomfortable. I saw demonic faces on my blanket. I  turned my blanket over and the faces went away. I feel my room moving in  3 dimensions. I begin to get scared again. Anxiety increases even  faster than before. I start to have regret in taking the ayahuasca. Why  did I even do this?

2:00-2:30 &gt; A  minute feels like an hour. Everything I see is shaking and radiating  with energy. Geometric patterns appear in my vision and I hallucinate  random objects appearing and disappearing. Humming noise is loud. Mild  nausea. Body high is strong. Hard for me to move. I had random muscle  spasms. I begin to lose grip on reality. Anxiety is high and bad  thoughts began to penetrate my mind. I kept thinking I shouldn’t have  done this and that I did something horribly wrong. I had to fight to  keep the bad thoughts away. This was happening in what felt like an  endless time loop. I was genuinely terrified. I want to become normal  again. I thought I was never going back to normal.

2:30?  - 3:00? &gt; Time does not exist. I was cold and very thirsty. I drank  some water and I felt every water molecule going down my throat. It felt  like an eternity when the water finally entered into my stomach. My  vision was just a wave of energy. Everything was so dreamlike. More bad  thoughts enter my mind. I thought I was going to die. I imagined  different scenarios where I would die. The worst thought I had was  getting a knife and stabbing myself right there in my bed. I  contemplated suicide just so I can end this trip. I just want everything  to be over. I want this trip to end so badly. But I know I had to  endure it. I fought the bad thoughts away as hard as I could.

3:00?  - 3:30? &gt; Ego death begins. My mind shatters into pieces. I could  not think clearly anymore. My mind becomes a jumbled mess of thoughts  and information. I thought I was going insane. I imagined this is what  schizophrenia feels like. I imagined I was going to be confined in a  mental institution forever and ever. I lose complete awareness of my  physical body. I close my eyes and saw visuals I cannot describe with  simple words. Like drifting between dimensions of complex, melting  geometry of otherworldly shapes zooming past me at light speed. I begin  to accept my death. Maybe dying isn’t so bad after all?

3:30?-4:00?  &gt; I achieve ego death. I drift into the subconscious. It felt like I  was somewhere between being asleep and being awake.I lost all sense of  myself as an individual. I had no more emotions, no more thoughts, no  more individuality. If I could describe this in one word it would be  nothingness. It was peaceful. Perhaps this is what dying feels like.

4:00  - 6:00 &gt; I “wake up” back into reality. I feel an overwhelming sense  of warmness, belonging, happiness, and contentedness. I feel very  talkative and my mind is racing with thoughts. I become very open with  my thoughts and feelings. All of my fear and anxiety went down to  completely 0%. I had nothing but positive thoughts and emotions. I kept  thinking to myself that life is beautiful. I feel like I discovered  purpose in life. This is the happiest I have ever been. There is still a  strong body high. Moving my body is difficult and is a struggle. Every  time I move I feel every atom in the body part vibrate.

6:00+  &gt; I can feel the effects of the ayahuasca diminishing and slowly my  normal state of mind returns. The feeling of contentedness and happiness  stays, but at a lower level. I feel relaxed and at peace with  everything. Even though I was very terrified at the beginning of the  trip, I go to sleep on my bed with no bad thoughts at all.

10:00+  &gt; There was an afterglow the next day when I woke up. I was clear  headed, very focused, and everything seemed more vivid to me. Decreased  social inhibition and felt more confident. Felt relaxed and peaceful.  Slight headache. The afterglow lasted for a couple hours after I woke  up.

Final thoughts: I would rate the  overall trip as a positive experience, although it was MUCH more intense  than I thought it would be. I thought I was mentally prepared but I was  not. It was simultaneously the most terrifying and beautiful experience  in my life. I am still trying to comprehend what happened that night. I  would not do this again anytime soon. IMO this is a spiritual,  enlightening experience that should not be abused regularly.",Ayahuasca,Ayahuasca Sandwich... First Time Trip Report
881,"A [recent episode of the Psychedelic Salon podcast (#587)](https://psychedelicsalon.com/podcast-587-good-news-on-the-psychedelic-front-pt-1/) hosted part of a talk Rick Doblin gave at Burning Man on August 31 2018. While talking about the doses used during the MAPS MDMA for PTSD trials he mentioned the fairly common practice of trying to dose MDMA based on body weight. He disagreed with that and explained that results from the clinical trials seemed to disprove the concept behind it. 

It's at 1:01:02 in the podcast, I roughly transcribed it below.

&gt;Some people have talked about trying to do dosing on the basis of milligram per kilogram, dosing in body weight. But that’s pseudoscience. That seems like scientific, milligrams per kilogram, super precise, but our first phase one dose response safety study that we did that way, milligrams per kilogram dosing, the subjective experience varied more widely than we did fixed dose. And when you think about it, psychedelics, nobody doses LSD based on body weight [laughter]. Or Psilocybin really. Sometimes that's being done, but psychiatric medications are not dosed on body weight.

899,"I ask this because I had a really peculiar (and beautiful!!) experience while in a 21 day dieta with the Noya Rao tree recently.

I am drawn to doing dieta with the Chiric, but the Maestra I was working with recommends most people to start with Noya Rao as their foundation. She works mostly with these two, and Bobinsana. She says they are good allies, but definitely not to be mixed during dieta... which I had no intention of doing, of course. I was asking after the Chiric from curiosity. 

I was also working with another plant medicine for my specific health issues (called Jerbon Sacha - no idea how this would be spelled though, sorry) and along with mapacho and the uni/Ayahuasca, it made for a pretty intensive experience.

One of the things I was working on were hard lumps in my gut. The other plants were doing a pretty awesome job at clearing away the blockages, but there was one that I have had for many many years which was having a hard time shifting.

Somewhere around my 8th or 9th ceremony, I made my way to the toilet (a nightly theme - my purging was mostly of the lower-region variety), and there I was sitting on my throne when I started visioning the most beeeeautiful blue light. It was the strongest eyes-open vision I've ever had. The light seemed to be moving directly into my gut, where the blockage was. At this point I purged.

When I stood up, I gave my gratitude to the plants for the shift and purge as per my custom, naming each aloud. To my surprise, Chiric Sanango came out first. I thought, silly billy, I'm not dieting with the Chiric Sanango. 

Back in ceremony I reflected on this and could not shake this feeling. I then remembered the description that people who diet with Chiric often give of this plant when it comes to visit them - in the form of a blue light, often with a masculine face. I didn't see the face, but I am certain that the spirit of Chiric came to me that night in ceremony to assist in moving that physical blockages, and that the other plants cleared a path to allow that to happen.

I find this bizarre and facinating, but mostly I feel incredibly blessed. I know for sure that when I go back I will be dieting with Chiric Sanango.

I have an opportunity to do it in a few weeks, or do it in May (based on work schedule).

I am struggling right now in life and am very desperate to do it now. I am struggling in work and social life, and am wrongly thinking of aya as a major cure. However, I seriously fear it and don't think I'm as ready as I could be. I have been eating cleanly and should have no problem with the dieta.

However, I feel with the extra 2 months I could prepare alot better, in terms of meditating more regularly, having a bit more experience with shrooms (I had trouble accepting/surrendering during my first few ceremonies) and fitness. 

I am aware that there is only so much preparation you can do for aya though. I am not sure if it is worth waiting 2 months to better prepare myself, and if doing so will make a worthwhile difference.

905,"The Human Death Exp.

20mg Dmt freebase with 120-180mg harmine hcl. I generally wake up around five a.m. naturally and dose the harmala alkaloids one hour after waking. Only drinking water the first few hours after waking up. Thirty minutes after dosing the harmala alkaloids I ingest the twenty milligrams of DMT freebase.

This is my diet, it works well with me and is very selective and restrictive.  

Generally consume two grams of cannabis a day.

No alcohol is in my diet except from kambucha once a week.

Diet for one week prior, during and current. Water, ample amounts of water. I’ve always been one to preach and practice about the lack of water humans consume. I generally consume at the very least one gallon a day with trace minerals. RO (reverse osmosis) water of course.

Surplus amount of cashews, almonds, walnuts and macadamia nuts. RxBar and Kind bar in the morning with orange and banana. Polyphenol mix drink. Three eggs for lunch. In the evening I will generally eat oatmeal, brown rice with noodles. Never any dairy products, no need.  No bread as well.

No other drugs or substances. I tried my best on collecting everything that I ingested. I don’t eat much and its for nutrition for comfort. Lots of water.

Two full droppers of Potassium Iodine every morning.

I go through periods of malnutrition and fasting along with intermediate fasting. Eating has been reduced down to nutrients over nourishment.

Since starting the micro dosing my days are boasting full of energy. Sleep is right on Que as well. Which is the best part? The dreaded TOOTHACHE!

I’d had a toothache prior to daily experimentation of DMT and harmala alkaloids. Now this one tooth was a stubborn life long curse so I truly believed. Every winter the toothache returned. Head splintering pain. Had to get one removed five months prior on the right side of my mouth. Ends up the sensitivity I’ve experienced my whole life was due to being in the one percent of people that have three roots on a molar instead the usual one or two.

Well, during the first week, I had an experience of a total of 400mg of harmala alkaloids and 120 mg DMT freebase. It was something else for another time, the main healing that I obtained from that experience was a resonating frequency that rattled the entire left side of my head down to the core of my tooth. I took a deep breath in and exhaled deep. Love, smiles, peace, content, ease and appreciation of self was overwhelming. The power that the harmala alkaloids hold are incredible. Still no tooth pain of any kind whatsoever.

Currently on the third day of completely eradicating nicotine from my life. Nicotine has been with me in some for or another for half my life. Literally. Since the trip and microdosing my shift of conscience and layered thought pattern have let me be analytical of my emotions that arise during a nicotine surge, I simply acknowledge it and pass on. Truly overcame nicotine addiction I feel. That will be a test of time.

Mentally, my philosophy has not changed but rather been tweaked. After a life of constant spiritual exploration which would look to be homelessness and poverty but an endeavor on the human mind and what constitutes reality. Epiphanies seem to be common, self realizations of inner space and outer space. Any sliver of depressive or reckless behavior is completely absent. Total control and moderation with all intake and output. The amount of “real” control feel is immense. Many thoughts keep coming to mind of a theory that ancient human took in more mao a inhibitors that also led to the natural synthesis of dmt to be more prominent. Thus letting the natural flow of dmt be present potentiated and prominent in a multitude of cultures.

Typing this is the second week of microdosing with oral DMT and harmala alkaloids. There has been a shift in my perception, imagine if you can, all the sudden your vision looks as if progressive scanning has been activated on a monitor screen. It is constant. The build up of psychoactive effects are prominent, colors are brighter with a vivid detailed in depth hue with layers of intrinsically shading system. The reason the air seems “full” whenever you look around on dmt with your eyes open. That becomes more accessible with more frequent use. So hear me out. The abundance of dmt lets one be in the moment with reality. The many levels of reality. So many levels that it all comes down to one. Time has almost truly dissolved. I’ve eradicated procrastination from my attributes. This chemical substance is truly the essence of nature and reality. Once you are inside of that world. Take out the aspect of spiritual and realize physical, metaphysical and spiritual are all the same. Its beautiful and I’m satisfied with my findings and results.  

Over all I have always been a happy person, not outgoing to other people. Put me into a stand off with an entity and I will never back down from their intimidation factor. I always marvel in their awe and treat them as an equal. Just as I do humans.

On the fourth night I went to sleep around 9:45 pm and woke up at 1:30 am. Smoked cannabis, drank two full glasses of water. Smoked 40mg Dmt freebase and an entity rushed me and forced his being on my self image. I never backed down or felt frightful in my own rite. My psyche knew that if something happened like that in the tangible world, then I should fear for my life. Which led me to having a breakdown of thoughts and analyzing concepts and ideas which eliminated the need to rely on irrational fears that are usually prominent and known for lurking in general psychosis patients. Visualizing is key to changing mindset. The mindset is key to visualizing change.

I put myself through this and extended years of trials and tribulation with a multitude of compounds, substances and metaphysical magic. Nothing compares to the mystical mindset of deep understanding that comes with the harmala alkaloids. As far as tolerance goes, there has been no tolerating the substance. Which inclines me to believe that dmt doesn’t necessarily act like a compounding substance. I’ve had instances where I would take minimal MAO inhibition with heroic doses of dmt. I can attain the same experiences while doing the diet mentioned above with daily use of harmala alkaloids and around 40-100mg dose range. So dmt acts differently by it doesn’t compound but rather the amount will result in the frequency you resonate with compiled and articulated from surrounding energy fields.

Persistent radiating internal vibrations are always apparent. As well with tracers and always prevalent in depth analysis of my surroundings. I feel as if I’ve hit my primal pinnacle of exploration and fascinating ideas of mystical answers. I’m happy with life now. The never ending ouroboros reality we live in will never satisfy the needy. Its not tangible.              

Honestly I could go on for days. In the end DMT in conjunction with harmala alkaloids have healed me physically and mentally. I went into this journey fifteen years ago and being persistent with well over three hundred encounters with different psychoactive plants. I’m not claiming to have tried them all. But would say that I’m up there with other pyschonauts that dedicate their mind and body to the underground world of metaphysical science.

I do plan on going back on my notes and making a more detailed report of micro dosing oral dmt and harmala alkaloids.

I have booked a 3 week retreat in Peru next month that includes 9 ceremonies and many other plant remedies on top. This will be my first ayahuasca experience and I'm looking forward to them but I am also a little nervous, or should I say very nervous. I have always felt a connection to ayahuasca and DMT because I feel it can get to the deep root of the issues people face with daily life that counselling and other remedies don't do for me. I have very strong intensions for mother Aya, but I'm worried that she'll show me a dark side that i won't be able to handle what she shows me in my visions. 

I do suffer from low self esteem and depression that has been going on for a long time. I'm hoping to face the traumatic memories that have chained me down for so many years and finally be able to look at my life in new way, and finally forgive myself for what people have done to me and what I have done to them. I read a lot about people having bad trips which I guess you can expect if you're taking psychedelics that make them worse than before and that's my biggest fear.

I'm wondering if anyone on this board can give me some insight on there experience with using ayahuasca to help them heal from a traumatic past.

909,"Hi,

I have a friend that has taken MDMA several times but has never really experiences any psychoactive effect for more than 5-10 minutes, even in doses up to 250mg on an empty stomach. My guess is because she is an ultra-rapid metabolizer of the CYP2D6 and perhaps some other enzymes. This makes sense since she needed very high doses of some medications that she used to be on for several years. She is not currently on any medication, since about 1 year.

Before anyone doubt that was really 250mg pure MDMA, I just wanna say that this batch has been tested many times and gives a light effect at 75mg, and a strong effect at 125mg, so it should be pretty damn pure.

I do not like the idea of giving my friend more that 250mg of MDMA because of the side effects like speediness, increases in body temperature and overall stress to the body.

The only thing I can come up with is to inhibit the enzymes responsible for metabolizing MDMA. 

These include at least: 

CYP2D6

CYP1A2

CYP2C19

CYP3A4

I just ordered a ancestry dna kit to confirm that she is an ultra-rapid metabolizer.

Are there any ultra-rapid metabolizers that have figured out a way to feel the effects of MDMA in doses under at or below 250mg, or what dose i necessary to really feel the effects?

Since Bupropion, [""blocks the effects of acetylcholine""](https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/ask-the-doctor-which-antidepressants-have-anticholinergic-effects), I believe a cholinergic supplement would have little to no effect on me.

&amp;#x200B;

I've also read conflicting opinions regarding the consequences of extended use of Bupropion. I've heard that your body may begin to compensate for it's lack of acetylcholine and find another way to store your memories, but I don't believe this to be true. Theoretically, wouldn't your brain eventually stop producing acetylcholine, leaving your memory permanently suppressed even after you stop taking Bupropion? Or does the poor memory side-effect eventually subside?

[https://www.acast.com/theevolver/dennismckenna-theenthogenicimagination](https://www.acast.com/theevolver/dennismckenna-theenthogenicimagination)  


I have been working with the host, Ken Jordan, a co-owner of The Alchemist's Kitchen in NYC, for a few months now. He is truly an incredible person, and a phenomenal host! He has been involved in this scene on a professional level, and on the level of personal practice for years. He has so much experience, and is so knowledgeable about these medicines. They go down some fun conceptual rabbit holes, and discuss so many topics that many of us sadly don't get exposed to, too frequently.   


I truly love this podcast, and have worked so hard on it. I really hope you all dig it! &lt;3  


We are on iTunes, GooglePlay, Spotify, and Acast!

The McKenna brothers — Terence and Dennis — are widely regarded as having paved the gringo road to the Amazonian plant medicine experience. Dennis’ exploration of this territory dates back a half century, and he is among its most knowledgeable cartographers. In this episode, he and Ken discuss questions that arise when entheogens are an important part of your life: What’s the difference between a plant psychedelic and a chemical? How should you choose a shaman? What role does integration play following a plant medicine journey? Are the entities you encounter under the influence of DMT real? What is actually going on when you trip?          

Dennis McKenna is an American ethnopharmacologist, lecturer and author. He is a founding board member and the director of ethnopharmacology at the Heffter Research Institute, a non-profit organization concerned with the investigation of the potential therapeutic uses of psychedelic medicines. He is an adjunct professor in the Center for Spirituality and Healing at the University of Minnesota. McKenna’s research led to the development of natural products for the Aveda Corporation, as well as greater awareness of natural products and medicines more broadly. He has authored or co-authored over 50 peer-reviewed scientific papers and written books, including “The Brotherhood of the Screaming Abyss: My Life with Terence McKenna”, and co-author of “The Invisible Landscape” with his brother Terence. He is also on the advisory board of the Soltara Healing Center in Costa Rica, where he leads retreats.

I fasted and had diet for longer time before that experience. I took it seriously and prepared myself in very ritualistic way, but Im glad that I did not drinked the brew back then. I received this guiding/vision which showed me that if I really want to heal myself I must prepare brew by myself with great intention.
I was trying to research some brew recipes but I was only been able to found those which use fresh caapi and viridis leaves. I only have dried Caapi shredded bark and Viridis leaves 8.8oz each. Im wondering where I could find more traditional recipe which makes potent brew. From some recipes I found the information was incomplete, for example how much of water goes in the brew.
I would like to get maximum from the dried bark, not wasting it at all, I dont mind standing around the pot for long time at all, Im wondering how much of solution can be brewed from this amount of dried Caapi and Viridis.

947,"Before I first drank Ayahuasca, I was fairly familiar with people's reports of experiences both on Ayahuasca and DMT. While DMT trip reports fascinated me, it sounded a bit intense for me, and I've heard a lot of people comparing the two, saying Ayahuasca is a lot gentler and less extreme an experience.

So recently I participated in an Ayahuasca retreat, and all 3 times I drank, half an hour later I was dragged into something that seemed to resemble much more the experience of smoking DMT from all I've read - it felt like a total different dimension, with amazing complex visuals, that I didn't even feel like I was 'seeing' as I had lost all memory of existing, being human or having a body or mind, just felt like they were all that existed. I feel like there was so much I saw that I'm not able to recall as it was too weird to even think of or remember when back in a normal mindset, but which seemed so familiar during the experience, as if I was back to who I really was. I went through what seemed like an eternity having no idea where or who I was, only occasionally vaguely having a fragment of an idea that I was maybe some kind of being, and in some kind of ceremony. Whereas I've heard of people 'meeting spirit animals' or similar, any ""entities"" I came across were far, far weirder than aliens, never mind mammals (and I can only imagine they're what is being described when DMT users talk about 'machine elves' although that doesn't begin to describe how bizarre and weird they were).

&amp;#x200B;

It seemed like most other people's experiences mainly consisted of revelations about their life/personality, dying experiences, physical sensations etc, but nothing quite as intense or weird.

&amp;#x200B;

Has anyone else had this experience of seeming particularly sensitive to Ayahuasca, or having a full DMT like experience with it?

951,"The medical community is under the impression greatly that gabapentinoids like gabapentin and pregabalin (Lyrica) are relatively safer than benzodiazepines as a treatment for anxiety, even though anxiolytic uses for the gabapentinoids are off label and a direct result of inhibition of excitatory neurotransmitters via calcium subunit activation. These drugs are also used in patients with addiction history specifically alcohol/benzodiazepines. 

Many people who use gabapentinoids long term talk about a severe withdrawal. I suppose this can be attributed to a decreased response to endogenous activation of the calcium sub unit. Studies also clearly show that these drugs prevent synaptogenesis which to me is one of the most prevalent side effects I can think of long term. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/29338087/

With benzodiazepines we do notice a decreased cerebral density over a long term that does not necessarily indicate neurotoxicity but at least down regulation of GABAa receptors. Also the withdrawals with this class of drugs is highly known and can cause horrendous effects to the user. 

What I’m really trying to get at is what do you all think about these two classes of drugs in terms of their long term efficacy and whether or not one is “safer” than the other to the brain in that long span. As well as, which causes the most problems concerning ending treatment long term.

959,"Putting my own personal motivations aside, the attraction to selective androgen receptor modulators or SARMS is quite obvious - (in theory) they are supposed to give Steroid like gains without being as physically damaging. I did quite extensive research including reading through the very limited literature on human use of these drugs. I will briefly outline the major reasons why I don't think anyone who is attempting to make an objective decision about their health.

To start,  I should note that while there are many drugs sold under the title of SARMS; there are a number of drugs (Mk677, GW etc) which have different mechanisms of action.

The most fundamental selling point of SARMS is that they (a) produce steroid like effects and (b) do not possess the same side effects. Anyone who has done 5 minutes of research into SARMS will notice that it's actually very difficult to find reliable logs of people using these drugs with any great effect. The overwhelming consensus is that their effects are fairly mild - even for the stronger ones. The only studies on SARMS in humans were for MK-2866 aka Ostarine to treat Cachexia, or muscle wasting during cancer.  The doses used were significantly lower than those suggested for muscle gain and the patient population used in these studies were elderly women. Even at these low doses - side effects were observed.  Just because Ostarine prevented muscle wasting in elderly women this does not mean that taking 10x the amount will add muscle to a healthy young man.

I just want to make this clear because it's so often spoke about as if people know what they're talking about. The reality is there is next to NO research done on these drugs meaning by taking these drugs, you are conducting the first human trials.

What is increasingly common is reports of people who've had blood work done and had elevated liver enzymes, bad lipid profiles and suppressed hormones.  If you look on the internet, the ONLY people who talk about the benefits of SARMS are those trying to sell them - which is why chemicals which are not SARMS have been lumped in with them - as a way to capitalise on the marketing.  These people exploit the knowledge that there are lots of young people like myself who want to believe in something that's going to replace hard work and time with no side effects. But that is not how the real world works and as any pharmacologist knows - that's not how drugs work.  To suggest that SARMS will not suppress/shut down your endogenous production of test is just wrong - that's not how your bodies negative feedback loop works.  A big part of my rational for looking into them was the belief that they would not shut down my own production - but to really think this is true is just naive.

In addition to this, the SARMS being sold are notoriously impure and there is a good chance you're either receiving nothing at all or something more harmful. I think a big reason why people end up taking these is because they desperately want to believe that their is a short-cut. I did. But the more I looked into it the more I realised that it just wasn't worth it. In the future these might be worth pursuing but at the current time it's just not a smart choice.

tldr;

\&gt; There is extremely limited data on the effects and side effects of these drugs in humans

\&gt; People commonly report steroid like suppression, effects on cholesterol and elevated lipid values

\&gt; Finding even anecdotal evidence of the efficacy of these SARMS is difficult

\&gt; There is a good probability you will either not receive what you ordered or something much more toxic

\*\*noticed the giant shit-storm in the comments lol. I am not telling people what they should/shouldn't do with their body - just the conclusions I came to in researching these and why they weren't right for me. 

If you are going to make big claims you have to have the evidence to back this up - very little exists. If you have had a positive experience on SARMS upload a log, show before and after photos, your diet, your blood work.  I made this post because it was clear to me there is a distinct lack of clarity and misinformation regarding these...even forum to forum.

Have had bulimia/binge eating disorder and insomnia for the last 5 years, and have been using weed daily to sleep and to (I see that now) run away from myself and my emotions. Haven't been quite happy with myself and not feeling good in my body as well all that time.

I did one ayahuasca ceremony last week where my intention was to face my fears and see why I developed that destructive habit that's taking away my happiness and to finally face whatever has been bothering me for such a log time and to finally move on in life.

I took three cups (first two didn't do anything at all) and I just laid down and ""fell asleep"" for the entire journey. Didn't purge and didn't see  anything rather than feeling good in my body in that moment. When everyone was coming back to reality I got anxious because I thought I was going to stay in that state forever and that's when I realized that I just want to be sober more than ever, because it's the best feeling there is.

I didn't get what I expected, but now that I think about it, I got what I needed for now. I know that a true healing happens after ayahuasca if you yourself commit to putting work in, but I'm still struggling with those habits (although I'm not using weed for sleep anymore because I sleep like a baby now, which is unbelievable) and am still stuck with not knowing why am I still doing it.

I guess I just want someone's opinion on what do they think about this and what would they do next. I feel like I should do another ceremony, but I'm not sure if what I experienced meant that I wasn't ready yet.

the weeks and months following this trip were a trip in itself as i assimilated to my new mindset. i've tripped on acid and shrooms and dmt many times but aya was definitely the one that took me completely out of this world. no shamanic rituals were involved but when you are in a hawaiian rainforest everything is kind of a shamanic ritual. you just need a decent mindset and a tripsitter and to trust yourself. looking forward to making some brew myself and journeying even further next time.",Ayahuasca,an ayahuasca experience.

Drink the rest of the tea.

Instantly feel muscle/joint relaxation and more intoxication.

11:03

Nice slight buzz, put on some music and it sounds great, not exactly enhanced but a slight warmth added. Sense of peace and wellbeing (I felt anxious earlier)

I put on a blanket and stay seated listening to Ralph talk (its quite relaxing and his videos on fear are relevant to me right now).

No visual effects but when he moves he looks like Claymation.

11:15

1 sip of mimosa juice

11:23

No effects yet, a few more sips

Feel a little nervous/weird. When I put down the bottle it felt like I kept putting it down repeatedly.

11:28

A few more sips

11:35

Still nothing, few more sips

11:44 my guitar looks like its “growing” and my bed looks like its inflating when I see it in the corner of my eye. LMAO? Why does everything look like its moving but it never goes anywhere. Everything on my floor looks like its slipping and I feel like im spinning.

Im putting on music (shpongle) and the face is popping out the screen and moving weirdly.

11:56

Got up to pee and check my eyes, look maybe slightly dilated but not really noticeable. I feel slightly nervous and im cold so I wrap up more in blanket.

A few more sips, just spooning it in. MY shirts on the floor still look like they are growing, and expanding like pancakes.

Sounds seem weird now like the bass is reverberating in a freaky way.

Spinning is intensifying, I feel weird. Orbs in the corners of my eyes. FUCKING DRIVER SCAN scared the crap out of me.

Now my shirt is slithering across the ground, where is it going, what does it want, how does it move like that.

Ok now it took the form of a crocodile like literally the exact shape and structure and started staring at me. I picked it up and threw it across the room.

The occasional commercials seem so weird, like fake.

Im feeling a bit sick now and its spinning and I feel a pressure in my whole body. Im just going to sit down here and put my head back

Im vibrating and so are the walls they are cracking open and penetrating me.

12;23 DEFINITELY KICKING IN

I PUT ON THE CHANTING TO SAVE ME IM SHAKING AND CANT TYPE WTF

I FEEL like its raising me higher somewhere im slipping into my mind.

Vision of these weird beads moving wtf that shape was so weird the screen so weird moving and shit. The music is taking me somewhere I have to go

Its showing me things  they pop up in vision heads exploding

1244

Shreks head exploading hes testing me

Wtf am I saying

1246

I come back and then fade again. I see orange and green colors vibrating, I cant stop shaking.

145

Imake it backhes showed me so much how to swim like them sing like them how to die and fall like them just be, he wants to show me more, is written.

We are at peace now

He tested me first to know my strength

I need to drink more

151

I drink another dose

Its getting harder to drink tasts like bile

Another quarter gone

2:58

I think the purging is finished. Im coming back for good now but it feels weird, my hands look weird the fingers so long and alien like, dream like wisps.

He wanted me to purge, he showed me fountains pouring and overflowing red liquid and told me to drink and then after I drank the liquids kept flowing and I couldn’t stop them and I kept vomiting them up.

What he showed me I can reflect on now: He fought with me first and showed me all the horror,there were pounding drums coming out of nowhere which I soon realized were my own heart beats, there were  heads exploding into dark red blood, clowns menacing and threatening and I tried to fight him. I felt myself fill up with light and wanted to overcome the darkness but I couldn’t. For everything I gave was countered equally and oppositely by the other. I formed a lightning fist that was countered by concrete and there was nowhere to push it. I knew that I had to give in and stop pushing hopelessly and that’s when I experienced pure bliss and fell in with the fundamental..  there were all these little tiny people that ebbed and flowed and formed these giant geometric patterns and then they were shot out of cannons and ran through meat grinders and turned into death, the paste of death and reborn. They then floated upward and linked hands into an huge geometric link that spread out over infinity and they became completely interwoven in a dense fabric that then condensed into rain flowing through the river. They all ran through the river. They wanted me to swim like them through the river in harmonic motion and showed me what happened if I tried to fight it. Everything in the river was a line of little people flowing endlessly and sexually procreating and then dying and blossoming again.Then this ran on infinitely and weaved itself into a beautiful snake that dipped and dove up and under the water. The snake was HER and it loved the water. She wanted to show off, wanted me to see her, wanted to tease me. And it weaved up and met these other beings. They were blue and had big heads and there were thousands surrounding me all staring at me with their eyes so bright, so perturbed for once and then focused back on the mission, who were they?

When I came back down I could still see the tiny people, perfect people forming their perfect patterns thoughtlessly, so wet and slick, so focused and harmonic. I saw other geometries that they formed and beads flowing and I saw candies turning into candy worlds with horror creeping in and then I saw more perfect people patterns.

&amp;#x200B;

320

The other thing Id like to reflect on is what happened when it started kicking in . It happened so fast changing from slight trippy to 1000 percent mode. I felt like there was an ancient presence and I knew deep down what it was but I was trying to put it out of my mind. Then it kept growing and growing till I couldnt ignore it. And it started lifting me from body into mindspace and I felt it pulling me. Throughout this process I could take a break and open my eyes but then it would start to communicate, idk how, like telpathically and it wanted me to come back and eventually I relinquished control to it. It also felt like this power was controlling everything. It was through and within the room and making the walls inflate, I saw it move electric sockets in and out and take lava out of a lamp on my desk. I felt very cold and alone. The only thing that saved me at this point was the Hare Krishna chant which brought the out the frequency of the fundamental in me, and the plant I held beside me from which I could feel the warm emanating breath of life.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT:

Final Remarks

No apparent adverse reaction to MAOI in spite of being on antibiotics, consuming red meat, and consuming whey protein

No nausea and pleasant taste from first dose of MHRB. Horrid taste and nausea from second and after that some light purging. Its unclear why the change occurred though the fact that my stomach felt raw, empty, and acidic at that point could have to do with it. Still....the purging seemed integrating in the experience. I felt the presence compel me to keep drinking until I purged.

Grapefruit juice worked well to mask the flavors of both substances

988,"I've never taken Ayahuasca, but have been planning on doing it for a couple years now, and it looks like I'm going to have the opportunity to do so within the next coupe of months. My research into ceremonies has me thinking that there are two ways of doing this:

&amp;#x200B;

The Traditional Treatment, in which drinkers have dark trips where they are forced to confront demons, feel like they're dying, then come through on the other end feeling better than ever. Equated with Masculine energy and lower chakras.

&amp;#x200B;

The New Age Treatment: Drinkers are led by Shamans who don't let them get to the darkness of their own minds, instead lead them down a path of love and enlightenment.

&amp;#x200B;

Honestly, I think I would rather have the traditional treatment. It seems more genuine, and I'm the kind of guy who likes challenging and transformative experiences. Masculinity is a huge reason why I'm seeking the medicine, and want to have the most traditional manner of treating anxiety, shame, and depression in that context.

1002,"Each of my journeys started with the vision of a white snake , the medecine . 

My first journey was all about surrender and death . I have died 12 times, gaia torned me into pieces  , each time killed or brought back to life by different elements or animal (earth , water , fire , air , metal(farmer tools), octopus ). Death felt so good , liberating , cleansing and sensual. I let go of pride , ego , shame . 
Then all doors of the universe opened , full of light and  stars . No ends , no beginnings , no time . I was the cow , the dog , the roads , the sky , the earth , the river . I love what you love . Feel what you feel . We are ONE . 
Series of flashes with faces of people (ppl i did not know) , asians , europeans , africans .. all with shining blue eyes (like stars) . We are all connected . 
My first journey ended in space with my magic octopus who asked me to become an orator . Speak , communicate , share , lead with your words . And bang ! The octopus swam all the way to my brain .. boooom big flash of pure white light . The door opened. 
At the same time booom big explosion from my « back .. » yes .. no more shame .. i pooped in my pants (godness) . That obviously forced me to rush to the shower , my excrement looked like golden sand .. yes yes i can shit gold hahaha 
I had the most beautiful hot shower of my life , the walls turned into gold , i turned into a golden goddess , i felt so complete just having nothing . I felt so rich naked like a worm. Inner power inner wealth . Priceless . 
I put on clothes that i would usually never wear, brown like mama Gaia and was shining like a sun . 


My second night let me experience love . True love , all types of love . 
It start with chilhood / kids love . Very cartoonish visions . Hearts . Pink color . Couples holding hands . 
Then came the bull . Taurus/ Venus was on top of me . I turned into orange lava .. gentle and sensual flow of hot lava . Parts turned into ashes . Parts into fire flowers . I was feeling hot desire , my entire body felt so hot . I was desire , i was Venus . I was making love to myself and spreading heat . 
 Then came the sadness , i scattered into pieces like a Picasso painting . Different 4D geometrical shapes . Green lasers of light always in mouvement . A tear came out of my right eye . 
Then came self love ! I hugged myself like i never did before , i was ONE again . 
Finished my journey in a foetus position , niched in a tiny and so comfortable hole in the belly of mama gaia , the moon shining upon me . Motherly and tender love ... putting me to sleep . I smiled and felt loved . 

I had surrended and found self love . 
I was now ready for my final journey . 
Who am i ? 
Resurrection  ! Goddess patron of doctors . Medecine . Joy and Light . I AM and Accept who i am . THE LEADER . FORCE . Share your Divine light . 

Cycle of life . 
My white snakes appeared . This time it could fly , growing wings . 
Big Buddha is here, smiling .
My journey starts , i am soil , earthy mama Gaia. I am being worked , the field is being worked. Seeds are thrown/ planted , corn is growing , it is raining . I am fertile . 
The corn is being cut , corn is given way to ppl to be fed . 
They work my field / soil again . Plants are growing , i am green . 
I am now a river . 
I am air .
A forest is growing , animals are jumping around and being fed . Un oiseau vient butiner sur mon nez . 
I am life .
I huge flower grew on top of my nose , a light purple lotus.
It is growing and growing , bigger and bigger , higher and higher . 
I feel joy and laugh laugh laugh at loud , tears of joy are running down my face . I feel that my entire body is laughing and spreading joy .

I sat down , i am now a young flower dancing in the wind , rocking from side to side , i smile and laugh . I love life . Light purple little flower . 

I am now a grown up plant and i am celebrating Gaia , Life , i stood up went to the center of the room and danced . Ancient , ritual dance. Dancing for you sacred Gaia . Touching the ground and being grateful . Thank you . Spreading more joy to the room , dancing dancing and rubbing my warm belly.

I now return to my bed in that same room where we are all gathered .
I am laying down , the belly starts to get bigger and bigger . I am pregnant ! Joy joy joy i am happy , filled with love . I am a mother . My belly turned into the Earth with the Sun and a green plant . Pregnant with Gaia . My mission . I am fertile . 
I remove the clothes and blanket from my belly , it was burning hot . The sun . 
It all disappeared , belly is flat again . I feel dizzy , nausea . I think i want to vomit .
I get up and get on my knees , grab my plastic bag and start screaming , crying , feeling pain and joy at the same time . I was giving birth . Giving birth to Gaia. (Only ayahuasca came out) i gave gaia back to Gaia .
The entire room , all participants are now awake and staring at me .
Still on my knees , my entire body gets out of control and starts shaking shaking shaking . I am forced to stand up and feel my legs , arms , hands growing growing .. i am now on my toes , hands in the sky , i can barely stand on my toes . I am still stretching . I am a tree ! Tree of life . I can feel it all growing , booming , so powerful . I walked in the center of the room , my hands are fire , so powerful , vibrating so high with a divine force . I was now possessed with my own healing powers . Boom it activated . I roared like a lion , was fighting to bring my arms together .
Everyone is awake , staring , singing for me , clapping in their hands while i am
Muting into ME .
I start screaming « feel the joy ! » « sing! » canta canta canta ! 
I am still pacing up and down the room trying to embrace , control and be one with this new awaken force . I start singing singing , smiling . I am now a golden light . 
Never felt such a force ! 
Finally i manage to be able to feel my hands , bring my arms , hands together . I ACCEPT MY MISSION and WHO I AM .
I look at the room and each participant / friend. They were singing , smiling , loving .. healed . 
I hugged them one by one with such power , gave them what they needed and a piece of my light .
I was now laughing and crying of joy  , realizing what just had happened .Hallelujah we sang , he thanked me for being alive.

I got back on my knees and thanked Mother Earth , Sekhmet , ALL (one) and the Power of the Universe . 

Since then signs are flowing everywhere , it all make sense . It is clear . 

I had the most beautiful day  my life .

Hope it will resonate with as many of you , us .

1004,"Some threads tell you Amphetamines and Racetams are terrible and increase the odds of excitotoxicity in the brain, others say the racetams actually protect the brain from excitotoxic effects 

Some threads say taking a hero dose of noopept (100mg) is a recipe to fuck your brain over permanently, others say it's just health anxiety

All threads say Piracetam/Noopept + LSD potentiates the daylights out of the trip but induces exciotoxicity due to LSD hitting your AMPA receptors downstream the Glutamate response (or is it the other way around?) which due to the NMDA agonism of the racetam induces exciotoxicity; and that LSD which is basically the only drug that doesn't damage your brain (but could damage your psychological well-being and mental health) joins the category of drugs that do damage when you use Racetams/Nootropics with

Some say noots and MDMA brought back that feeling of the first roll and protects your brain from MDMA's well known neurotoxic effect no matter how mild they may be, while others say it amplifies them

As someone who takes a microdose every other day along with my regular morning dose of 2g of Piracetam and full trips once a month on 100-200ug with 2g of Piracetam have I been slowly damaging my brain over the last year without realising it or have I been protecting it

NMDA antagonists (Ketamine/DXM) prevent excitotoxicity and are taken sometimes at the same time as stimulants to prevent a tolerance buildup so would it not follow that NMDA agonists such as Piracetam increase tolerance and therefore the excitation at the synaptic cleft that's taking place?

1008,"Hey there,

So, my first retreat is right around the corner, and I'm still feeling quite apprehensive about it. I have a few weeks left before it, so I decided not to pay until either this or next weekend. This gives me some time to consider how long I want to go for.

The retreat lasts for four days in total (with one aya ceremony being each night), but participants are welcome to stay for as little as they feel comfortable.

I'm wondering if anyone has any advice on how long I should stay for. I initially wanted to spend three nights there, but my anxiety and fears of developing a severe drug-induced mental illness has led me to reconsider the number of ceremonies I want to go through. I was thinking that I should stay for one or two ceremonies instead.

I emailed one of the people in charge of the retreat and expressed my concerns to her; concerns with staying for too little and too long. In her response, she expressed her opinion that it would be best for me to stay for three ceremonies, as I would be likely to get the most healing value and benefit from that number. Even if one is enough for me, the additional two ceremonies may provide deeper insights into my first trip.

As I mentioned above, my main concern with putting myself through so many ayahuasca trips is developing a severe mental illness, specifically psychosis. I have a family history of schizophrenia, and I experience a lot of dissociation and derealisation myself, so I have good reason to be concerned.

I brought my and my family's history of mental illness up in the email I mentioned above. My correspondent consulted with a medical advisor, who got back to her and said that it's alright for me to have ayahuasca and kambo during the retreat.

So, before I actually decide whether I want to pay for two or three nights, I wanted to gather some opinions from others. What do you guys think?

Thanks in advance :)",Ayahuasca,Suggestion on length of retreat?

1026,"Hey all,

I did my ayahuasca ceremonies in December. Since then I've been having really bad reactions to alcohol. I wouldn't say I'm a heavy drinker - I'm British so it's part of the culture here to have a couple of social drinks maybe once or twice a week (at most). Since aya my tolerance has completely gone - beer is ok (only one or two though!) but if I drink wine or spirits I get terrible stomach ache and most times it makes me vomit. 

I have been drinking so little since I came back I hadn't put together the pattern until now - I thought maybe I'd just drank a bit too fast or had a sensitive stomach from eating, but I just had 2 whiskys over a long dinner and was immediately in a lot of pain and sick. It's a shame as I like the occasional drink but now I see the pattern, of course, I recognise aya is sending me a message and I'm going to lay off the booze from now on, but just wondering if anyone else has had a similar issue? 

I guess it's just a surprise as alcohol was not one of the issues I went there to address, and whilst I like the occasional good time, I wouldn't have characterised myself as having a problem with alcohol at all.

1032,"Hi everyone, this is just a little topic I've been thinking about for a while, and I wanted to get your opinions on this, especially those of you who are really veteran scientists here. If you're in a hurry feel free to skip all my yacking here ;-), hearing your opinion is more important to me than if you hear mine. 

When, as a student, you first start to read research articles, it can be tricky because often just understanding the subject matter is difficult enough, much less being able to tell if the writing is good, and the writer's logic is consistent. I'm at a point where I can make some judgments depending on the exact article, but not quite to the point that I can feel completely confident in those judgments, especially with more technically dense subject matter. 

I believe it's definitely worth discussing, as this represents a huge issue with the general public's understanding of science, that so often only those with a great deal of education and experience in these matters can even decipher if what is being said is correct. How often, when reading a ""popular science"" article about a research article, do you get the feeling the journalist did not go to any effort to see if the article and experiment were quality work, but picked it only for being ""interesting"" or producing an attention grabbing headline? 

Anyway a few things that set off alarm bells in my mind indicating an article may be less than excellent:

--The results are right in the title. This makes me very suspicious, it makes it look like that article is pushing an agenda. In my view, the nature of the question you set out to answer should be what is represented in the title, not the answer you believe you found. By putting your result in the title, it makes it seem like you may be prone to confirmation bias. 

--Superfluous or incorrect use of jargon. Usually the use of jargon is completely correct and justified, but in some instances, it seems as if the researcher is purposefully including as much jargon as possible to sound ""smarter"" or more ""professional,"" even when it is not in the correct usage, slowing down the reader and obfuscating the message being communicated. A perfect example of this is the word ""methodology"", frequently used incorrectly in neuroscience and biochemistry articles. [Methodology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology) means the study or art of designing experimental methods, but often the term is used in a place where the author clearly just meant ""experimental methods."". For example, they ascribe some amount of error in the results to the ""methodology,"" this is just redundancy here, it's the *methods* that caused the error, there is no reason to be using that term. In my mind the less jargon you use when possible, the better. 

--In the case of where, despite having all the specific technical details immaculately under control, the researcher missed some larger issue that should have been obvious as something that would decrease the value of the results and/or make inference of conclusions more difficult if not accounted for.

1033,"Something that’s been on my mind lately, as I keep seeing reports of people ordering Banisteriopsis Caapi online to brew Ayahuasca at home, but it also applies to the general use of Ayahuasca outside of the Amazon (as well as several centers IN the Amazon). 

The issue I see, is with regards to ethnobotanical piracy. Once a traditionally used medicinal plant is “discovered” in the West, often times Westerners will reap the benefits, but very little actually goes back into the hands of the indigenous people or to the land from which the medicinal plants originated. 

In regards to Ayahuasca, various reports show that Caapi is being eradicated from the wild, due to over-harvesting. If one purchases the Ayahuasca vine online that has been harvested “from the Amazon rainforest” it’s potentially contributing to this issue. But even if one purchases Caapi sustainably grown elsewhere (say the United States), I still see it as contributing to a botanical piracy of sorts, unless that money directly benefits the Amazon or it’s indigenous people. The same goes for drinking it in organized “ceremonies” outside of the jungle. Or even visiting retreat centers in the Amazon that are owned/operated exclusively by Westerners. 

I’m not saying that you shouldn’t brew your own Ayahuasca or drink it outside of the Amazon rainforest. I personally believe that Ayahuasca is trying to spread itself and it’s message around the planet. But the strongest “message” that I’ve continually received from Ayahuasca (whether I drink it deep in the Amazon or outside of it) is that we need to protect nature and the environment. And the beating green heart of that environment is the Amazon rainforest, and the native peoples living there who fight every day to conserve it. 

I’m not sure how many people on Reddit care about this issue, but it’s just a thought I keep having as I read the various posts on here about the “Vine of the Soul”. If you’ve taken Ayahuasca outside of the Amazon, maybe you still had visions of jaguars or anacondas, tropical birds or pink river dolphins maybe you even saw indigenous people. I don’t think that’s a coincidence. Ayahuasca is a message *from* the Amazon *to* the rest of the world. 

If you do care about this issue, here are a couple of ideas on how to counteract it. If your considering going on a retreat, instead of choosing a luxury center owned by foreigners, maybe find a small one where your money directly flows into an indigenous community in the Amazon? Perhaps even look beyond popular destinations like Iquitos or Pucallpa? Or if you can't travel to the Amazon, but Ayahuasca has profoundly effected your life in a positive way, maybe consider giving back to it’s source? Donate to a non-profit that helps counter deforestation in the Amazon or helps to empower the forest’s people? (Ex: Rainforest Flow installs clean water in Matsiguenka communities in South Eastern Peru.) Or maybe someone on here has a link to a website where one can purchase Caapi and Chacruna from a sustainable source, that also provides fair-trade income to indigenous Amazonian people (for all the home-brewers out there)?

3rd, I was always interested in the mystical aspect of the psychedelic experience. I don’t know if that’s a good enough reason to do ayahuasca?

1049,"Similar to how  Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors delay the break of acetycholine, semax &amp; selank delay the break of opioid receptors (KOR,DOR,MOR.. Nociceptin(NOP)..etc)

&amp;#x200B;

From wikipedia:

Semax, as well as a related peptide drug, [Selank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selank), have been found to inhibit [enzymes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme) involved in the degradation of [enkephalins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enkephalin) and other [endogenous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endogenous) regulatory [peptides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide) ([IC50](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IC50) = 10 μM), though the clinical significance of this property is uncertain.

&amp;#x200B;

To my understanding, enkephalins  are associated with opioid receptors (kor,mor,delta,dor).

From wiki:

The receptors for enkephalin are the [delta opioid receptors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_opioid_receptor) and [mu opioid receptors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mu_opioid_receptor). Opioid receptors are a group of [G-protein-coupled receptors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-protein-coupled_receptor), with other [opioids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opioid) as [ligands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligand) as well. The other [endogenous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endogenous) [opioids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opioids) are [dynorphins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynorphin) (that bind to kappa receptors), [endorphins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endorphin) (mu receptors), endomorphins, and nociceptin/orphanin FQ. The opioid receptors are \~40% identical to [somatostatin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatostatin) [receptors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)) (SSTRs).

&amp;#x200B;

My question:

As someone who suffers from dp/dr symptoms, I don't think semax is a good option, since various studies claim that opioid antagonists help with dp/dr symptoms.

&amp;#x200B;

Even beyond kappa,  It's not wise to agonise/delay breakdown of Nociceptin/Orphanin (NOP) opioid receptors:

# A Selective Nociceptin Receptor Antagonist to Treat Depression: Evidence from Preclinical and Clinical Studies

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4869049/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4869049/)

BTRX-246040 is a potent and selective nociceptin receptor antagonist which is under development by BlackThorn Therapeutics and Eli Lilly for the treatment of major depressive disorder. It has demonstrated proof-of-concept clinical efficacy for depression.

naltrexone 150mg/day was used in the study.

&amp;#x200B;

I actually suspect that my use of semax exacerbated dp/dr symptoms.  How would I go about reversing semax effect on my brain's opioid receptors? I mean I want them to break down, not delay the break of them!

&amp;#x200B;

I want something that is an antagonist of opioid receptors, beyond Amentoflavone, naloxone, naltrexone (which isn't available in my country) the most that is available is 0.4mg/ml 4 vials of naloxone for 40$,  I tried 4 vials to limited and very short term relief, also read somewhere that low dose naloxone would up-regulate the opioid receptors.

1053,"Hello everybody, I have a few questions for the doctors among you and please look it up, if I mess things up:


Should the serotonin level or the production of serotonin be high or low before an ayahuasca ceremony?


And the thing with tryptophan - L-tryptophan is the precursor of 5-HTP which is then converted into serotonin in the liver. Now, if I have researched correctly, then found in food predominantly L-tryptophan.


However, these are exactly those foods that should be avoided at all costs. Above all, they contain high levels of tyramine (aged, fermented foods) and tryamine makes the DMT ineffective.


On the other hand, many fermented foods have a probiotic effect and make L-tryptophan more readily available, so fermented foods apparently also indirectly support serotonin production.


So, if I say that correctly, then before a ceremony the serotonin levels should be as low as possible and all foods high in L-tryptophan and tyramine avoided, is that correct?


Supplementation of L-tryptophan, 5-HTP and serotonin should therefore be avoided, I see that also correctly?

I find ayahuasca to be a perplexing thing because unlike any other drug in existence it is possible to take a high dose and still not really feel like much is happening. It's been strange for me to be sitting in a group of a dozen or more people all having the most intense experiences, feeling like the odd one out. 

The most powerful experience I had was probably the first or second time (I forget which).  I experienced not much at all for like 3 hours and then at the end I remembered something bad from my past which I'd forgotten about and I vomited it up.  Actually that was quite a traditional aya experience now that I think about it.  But no visions, meeting spirit guides, talking to ancestors, nothing like that.  

I'm starting to think aya probably doesn't jive all that well with me.  Peyote and San Pedro on the other hand really seem to work well with me and I feel a lot of healing from them.

1058,"I had a psychotic break taking acid in college over the summer of 2014. I tripped alone. Prior to the trip I met the absolute girl of my dreams and I wanted to marry her. I was only 19. Unfortunately, and quite retardedly lovestruck, I thought I was on top of the world, fuck it - I was on top of the fucking universe. I mean, I thought I had EVERYTHING. Life was set. I got the girl, family would happen eventually, everything would fall into place just like a fairytale.   


Truth be told, it was too much for me - to put it simply, it was way too good to be true. So long story short, I questioned my reality - was this really happening this soon? All my life's dreams falling into my lap at 19? Couldn't be real. So I lost it mentally.  


Long story short, I had what doctor's called a drug-induced psychotic break. But  really guys, it was the fucking love I had for that girl. ANYWAYS, it's taken a few years to recover. I'm more lucid than I was BEFORE my ""psychotic"" break and I'm doing great.  


I'm searching for myself or what I'm not and I think ayahuasca is a good idea. I've thought about it but figured I'd post here to get some feedback. I hear a lot of people saying ""Oh, don't take it if you've had psychotic symptoms!"" Bullshit, that's a western style of thinking, but that's just my opinion.

1059,"I experienced my first ceremony last weekend. Since then I have been trying to fully process everything that happened. Reading the posts here has helped, but I'd like to hear more about those who have had death experiences. 

For me, the ceremony started out very well. Before drinking I sat and meditated, focusing on what I wanted to address. My goal was to overcome fear and to learn how to listen to the language of Nature. I am on my way to becoming a conservationist, so I feel like these are things I need to address/learn in order to be able to help preserve Nature. 

The first drink was wonderfully sweet and pleasant. The shaman was incredibly knowledgeable and kind, guiding us all through the entire experience. We were all told to lie down and let the medicine take hold. I closed my eyes and felt the most bizarre sensation of vines running through my body. I saw fractal shapes and softly blinking lights. I felt the medicine coursing through me. I heard everyone around me beginning to feel the effects (purging, moaning, dancing) and I said to the medicine that I was afraid. She guided me through the fear. Helped to teach me how to relax my body. Then she taught me how to breathe. How to look at what was frightening me. How to breathe and remain calm. I did not purge. I felt joy and serenity. I writhed on the ground like a snake, moving in time with the music that was playing. I felt she was showing me how to take care of myself before she would show me Fear.

Then came the second drink. This drink was the most bitter thing I had ever tasted (even though it was the same as the first drink). I knew immediately that this was Death. I gagged a bit and tried to sit with the bitterness. I felt heavy. I sat down again and suddenly I began to think about fear. I thought of my fear of traveling and I imagined myself dying while traveling. Then it hit me. I went through the entire process of dying a violent death. It was as though I was in a crashing airplane. I tried to breathe as I was taught, but the sorrow kept taking hold of me. I felt calm in some ways because of my breath, but such intense sorrow and pain because I knew I would never see my partner again. I cried in agony. I cried harder than I have ever cried before. I told myself in that moment that I would not travel because the pain was too immense. I felt like I couldn't face it. That allowed me to calm down. Until I imagined my partner dying. And then everything came crashing down. I fell into fits of intense grief and agony. I was crying out loudly, begging for it to stop. Begging for him not to be taken away. I've never felt such intense pain before. This agony lasted for hours. 

During this agony I saw the Jaguar in the shaman's drum. As they drummed and the others danced, it was like a celebration. It was Life dancing with Death. The Jaguar's eyes were the reflection of candles on the altar. His eyes flashed and I stared right into them. The Jaguar is always there, waiting to take one of us away. But then, the drumming stopped, and music played over a speaker. It was a lullaby, or so it seemed. And this lullaby hushed the Jaguar into a state of calm. Watchful but serene. I continued to look into his eyes with Fear. Respect, but Fear. I felt absolute terror at time, as though I was really standing before a Jaguar. 

The shaman came to me at one point to talk to me. They walked me through the experience. Asked me what was going through my mind. Helped me to release my energy. And they blew on me to expel the energy (I think. This wasn't really explained to me). They held me and caressed my back. They reassured me and told me that I am strong. That I am not me because of him. That we create beautiful energy together, but that I must appreciate this in the moment and not worry about what could or might happen in the future. After this they had me lie down again and rest. After that I began to calm down. I purged a few times. Cried a bit more. But eventually felt calm.
I spent the rest of the night on my mat. I watched the others and thought about Death and Life. I thought about living in the moment. About loving unconditionally. About loving Life. Appreciating Life. Never taking anything for granted. I thought: ""Life is a gift. And in return I offer Love"". This meditation got me through the night until morning.

The next day I felt refreshed, but also like I had been through the most difficult thing I could imagine (in terms of emotional strain). Since then I have felt sorrow and pain. Like all of these deep, buried fears have been dredged up. Laid out in front of me. Then released. But there are still residues from those fears. And I still feel the sting of pain. Like I've just had an invasive surgery and I feel the pain from my stitches.
I know this is all part of the healing process. But I am having some difficulty finding my way. I still feel the fear, but I am trying to acknowledge the lessons the Ayahuasca offered to me. It feels a bit like I have been given the chance to experience my worst fear in a way that is safe (ie. it didn't actually happen. my partner and I are still alive.) Almost like a Scrooge moment, where I've been shown the beauty and horror of life and now I have to decide how I want to live my life in response. 

Has anyone else had Death experiences like this? How long did it take you to integrate it? Do you always feel that pain? Did further Ayahuasca journeys help you to make sense of it all?

Part of me feels like okay, it's over now. It's okay. I can just get back to living. But another part of me is saying: NOW is the time to change. You have to. If you keep living in fear, you'll regret it.
So in some ways I've got this anxiety about not feeling afraid because I don't want to waste my precious life and time with the people I love. That's what's really been the hardest. 

I'll keep reading posts here to see what others have said too. Thank you to anyone who reads this. And thank you to everyone who has shared their experiences. This is beautiful medicine, but it is difficult as well. ",Ayahuasca,Death experiences? How to integrate Fear after intense Ayahuasca journey.

B.Caapi, DMT. 1:1

I had a more or less negative experience with an accidental microdose of changa. I was eating a protein bar at the time while burning a tiny amount (think half the size of a dime coin) to check to see if all the alcohol evaporated. It had but I ended up inhaling a little on accident as the actual changa started to burn (and only for maybe a second or two).

Afterwards I felt the holiness of the DMT but soon after felt a drudgy, dreary, slowness that I'm guessing was the B.Caapi (I've only experienced freebase before). This lasted for 10 to 40 minutes (time was kinda screwy) with me throwing up, having to use the restroom to crap a few times (apologies for the crudeness) and intermittently I'd experience very brief suicidal type thoughts as well as anxiety. Ended up walking around a bit trying to calm down then laying down in my bed listening to Jordan Peterson lectures.

Has anyone had or heard about negative experiences from Changa? I was eating a protein bar at the time as I mentioned so I think that could've contributed to it. I've read that food interactions can mess with your body and mind while on maoi. And I have read online the side effects with b. caapi and they match my experience. 

&gt;However, all Banisteriopsis caapi patients experienced adverse effects. They all experienced nausea/vomiting, and most of them also experienced dizziness, diarrhea, and agitation. One patient experienced confusion/hallucinations.-found online

I also could understand how what I experienced was normal and what was supposed to happen as I've heard Ayahuasca experiences can be very brutal and changa is a condensed version of that.

I have an extra level of (possibly irrational) concern because I've been screwed over before by nbomes (guy claimed it was lsd) in the past that sent me to the emergency room (this was over a year ago) and I'm worried maybe my history could have made me susceptible to a negative interaction with the maoi (b.caapi).

I've done DMT alone following my experience with nbome and it's always been beneficial. I had trouble breaking through and decided to go the changa route but this experience has kind of put me off/rattled me a bit. Overall the experience was bad but my mind feels like it's benefited on a micro scale compared to how much I thought it could benefit had I done the changa properly.

Another thought is that microdosing itself is just interesting and can be anxiety enducing. I microdosed shrooms and although beneficial, it can be a brutal experience being one foot in and one foot out of the psychedelic realm (for lack of a better word) so that could be something too.

Factors that could've contributed to the negative experience:

I was alone.

I was not fasting at the time.

It was completely unexpected (since it happened on accident) so I wasn't mentally prepped.

My history with nbomes.

Possible solutions:

Try the b.caapi alone to see what happens and whether I'm adverse to it.

Test the DMT in case it's 5meo (I've never tired 5meo but from what I can tell it definitely felt like DMT I've experienced in the past).

I'm trying to piece this together and I'm kind of scatterbrained. Because that was basically a microdose I'm thinking all the effects I experienced will be amplified exponentially including the negative effects which doesn't make me very comfortable and shocks me considering how much positive feedback I've heard about changa from the nexus. I'd appreciate any input. The thought of throwing up on changa (I do plan to have a guide and be safe) is fine but crapping and even the remote possibility of having minor suicidal thoughts is jarring and unappealing (i experienced similar thoughts although much stronger from my nbome experience, might be why I'm making some weird possibly irrational correlation). It makes me think I should go freebase but that itself is also brutal for it's own reasons and I wanted to do changa because it felt smarter and read you can absorb the experience more. What are your guys's thoughts? And what if you have any experience are the differences between a freebase journey and a changa journey?

I'd read with some e-learning while ago that codeine (dihydrocdeine) has a ceiling effect at 30mg. And no better analgesic effect is obtained whilst taking more example 60mg.

I remember from the presentation that peak effect is 2 hours whilst overall lasting about 4 hours. So would be better to be prescribed more often at 30mg with max of 240mg /24hr rather than 60mg QDS.

I would like to know if this is correct and if there is litriture to support it? I can't find any from a brief search.

Bought B caapi powder 100 g and 25 g chaliponga leafs. I don't wanted to trip today. I just wanted to taste it and see if the adverse effects are bearable for me so I put like 3 chaliponga grams and like 15 or 20 g of caapi powder together with half liter of water and put it to boil together for 30 minutes. I added lemon juice and 3 apple vinegar drops to it before boiling also added some sugar. The result was 2 brown cups of ""bitter"" tea. It was a 200 or 150 ml of aya tea in each cup. First I drank the small one and waited 30 min. I just felt a bit dizzy like if I was a bit drunk. Drank another half cup of tea and I was feeling the same when an hour passed. Decided to drank the last half cup but I was already tired of the bitter taste so I added like 50 ml of coca cola and it tasted better and 15 or 30 minutes later it began to slowly kick in. I don't remember why but I started being nihilistic af. Why are we here? What's the point of living? What if the truth doesn't exist? I asked myself. 
At this point I was full aware of myself and I began thinking that I tried a very small dose of aya so I wasn't expecting a strong trip and I thought that the trip had reached it's full effects by now. It felt like a weed high so I started listening to music. Music was slowly beginning to sound odd and very strong to me so I went to the bathroom. When I was walking to the bathroom I saw the mosquito repellant plant I bought days ago. The plant had some of the leafs turning brown and I couldn't stop looking at it feeling pitiful because it was dying. I noticed a small mosquito flying around the plant and I told myself with irony ""isn't life comical?"" and suddently I was feeling very sad, dizzy and heavy. When I went back to my room I was feeling colder and colder and began to tremble as if the temperature had dropped to zero grades. At this point I was far beyond what being high on shrooms or weed felt like and it made no sense to me because it was a very low aya dose. I refused believing that I was tripping on aya so I thought that I was having a brain stroke because MAOI [b. caapi in this case] are capable to increase your blood pressure if you take them with caffeine or too much proteins. I began recalling memories from my childhood that usually I am not able to recall and I realized that death scared me the most when I was a child. The fear became real and I constantly was asking myself ""are we living or are we dying?"" as I began to tremble harder. My eyes were open and I was looking at my legs but suddently I had visions of wild jungles and snowy mountains and it didn't bothered me but I was feeling extremely cold and trembled a lot. It felt like -20 degrees and I wanted to stop the trip because I hate cold and I wasn't expecting to trip at all. Also it made me think that I wasn't living but dying because when your body dies it gets cold. I closed my eyes and I saw geometric figures, something that draw my attention was seeing a closed eye opening by itself in the middle of the geometrical figures. Probably it was the third eye. I began thinking stuff that I can't recall but I remember that I had a vision with my eyes closed of a girl that was feeling perfectly fine and suddently the girl began to scream. [no, I didn't had any auditory hallucinations] My thinking became chaotic and disorganized. My internal speech began to repeat obsessively words that I can't remember because they didn't made sense to me. 5 or so minutes later I suddently was feeling ""sober"" again even thought that I was still trembling and feeling dizzy so I went to bed and covered myself with blankets. Another 5 mins later I stopped trembling and my face was so fking hot and the trip was over. 
I think that I began fully tripping when I saw the plant so the duration was around 30 minutes but I can't be sure because I lost the notion of time then. 1 hour at most. It's a pity that I didn't hallucinate. The question ""are we living or dying?"" was in my mind during the whole thing. My subconscious was trying to tell me that I am afraid of dying or is it normal to feel this way when trying aya?

1104,"I'm currently in Ecuador and am soon traveling to Peru. One of the things I really had my heart settled on doing during my trip was an Ayahuasca retreat. However, the more I research all the different centers and try to pick the one, the more that I'm struck by some common themes that have set doubt into me.

**1 - Marketing:**

Each center is trying to sell a sort of transformational experience. Some seem to have their intentions come across more purely than others, but it all seems a bit off to me because the narrative depicted is a very western depiction of personal growth, which seems odd to me from my understanding of tribal/shamanic beliefs.  And in fact, many of the people who I've heard talk about it talk rather focused on their connection with nature and understanding you're a part of a whole. Seems to me like something is off here.

**2 - Pricing:**

Furthermore, while surely a retreat shouldn't be free, the shamans and local community should absolutely be well-compensated, the prices of many of these retreats seem crazy to me. Even if they are highly rated, the price points and how they've shifted over the years makes it clear to me that there is a capitalization on marketing that is happening here, no different than it happens when someone buys a toaster or a cell phone. You get the deluxe toaster because you like it's sleek design/durability or you buy X phone because you're convinced you need these features. But do you really?

**3 - Can you just show up?**

When it comes to ayahausca, although I've not done it before, I question whether you need anything additional to a brew and a shaman, and the work do itself. I wonder if the more features we add, the less ""genuine"" the experience becomes and that it becomes more about a narrative of a personal journey/healing than a willingness to learn/grow.

In general, while traveling, I've learned than many times it's showing up and doing that leads you meet the right people and that the true holders of knowledge most often don't have an online presence. I'm a bit more hesitant to do that in the jungle, considering I'll be ingesting a psychedelic plant under the supervision of a person whose intent I don't know. But still, I feel like it might be the better option. The online ayahuasca circuit is leaving me with a sour taste, having an craigslist style platform for spirituality doesn't seem right to me, but does anyone have an alternative? Are there options that are decidedly different? Has anyone just showed up to Iquitos and tried this route? What's your experience been?

Keep  in mind the quotes from Palmer in part (2) above, as the brew form is  so much more potent, brighter, fuller, and complex (all encompassing)  than the alternative can be.

Here is what was dreamed in dreams:

1. 240g of hawaiian psychotria was blended in a blender to small pieces  (not to dust, but just enough to compact it into tiny pieces).  The leaf  was three years old and had been stored in a ziplock bag, it still had  not lost any potency whatsoever over the years.
2. It was added  into a plain metal pot with 128oz water as you want to use 16oz water  per each 30g of leaf, (16oz x eight 30g doses = 128oz water).
3. Boil it on medium-high boil for 45 minutes.
4. Filter the liquid and leaf through a spaghetti strainer into a container
5. Take the container of liquid and filter it through a coffee cone made  of fine wires that sits atop another container around 4 to 5"" in  diameter.
6. Then filter the liquid through a cotton ball sitting  inside a wide plastic funnel. Have two of these funnels with a cotton  ball stuffed in them sitting side by side, when the cotton clogs, simply  pour off the remaining liquid from the 1st funnel into the 2nd funnel  adjacent to it to continue the filtering, switching out the cotton balls  when they clog. Throw the used cotton balls away. You will need about a  dozen cotton balls for this process, but it only takes about 10 minutes  total to filter thru the cotton balls. It is well worth it.

Had  to change out the cotton ball in each funnel around 5 times total in  order to filter all of the approx remaining 2L (2 liters) of liquid from  the above beginning leaf boil.

7. Now the psychotria leaf brew is extremely pure (sediment free).

8. The liquid was then poured into a pot and reduced down to 24oz total, so that each 3oz of liquid = 30g of leaf.

9.  3oz of the hot liquid was poured into a measuring cup and caapi extract was added to the liquid and stirred. The rest of the leaf  liquid above (21 oz left was put away).

The dream:

The 3oz of leaf liquid with caapi dreamed at the same time resulted in a  +3 journey with three hours of closed eye visuals. With closed eyes saw  hours of brightly colored fantastic visions and visuals: incredibly  beautiful and neon colored with patterns of complexity far beyond the  imagination. The visions surpass anything ever seen in reality or works  of art. Animated faces and female human figures were seen of immense  beauty in cartoon colors with detail so far beyond anything an artist  could paint. With open eyes, world was infinitely beautiful, with a  significance that was utterly stupefying. Intensely sacred experience.

1/2  hour into the journey, watched the movie ""Letters from Juliet"" with the  beautiful Amanda Seyfried...the movie had hours of scenery filmed in  Italy of the stone buildings, winding stone walkways, houses overlooking  the mountains, and the actress...the beauty of the scenery was  mind-blowing, and almost too incredible to look at...it was sublime, of  such excellence, grandeur, or beauty that it inspired immense admiration  and awe. During periods of watching the movie, I would close my eyes  and continue the watching of flowing images &amp; visions of  breath-taking beauty.

The experience was quite strong, and next  time would dream less of the brew (like 2.5oz worth in combination with  the caapi) in order to experience a dream equivalent to 25g of the leaf.

1114,"Hi,

I suffer from PTSD caused of repeated childhood trauma, for 10 years. 

I already had 2 therapeutic MDMA sessions. 
The first one changed my life after a year of stuck therapy. After the second sessions I was still avoiding triggers, holding a lot of stress, confusion, and sometimes panic. Always trying to have as much possibilities as possible in every choice I need to make, this only made me more confused. 

I held for so long the hope for cathersis. I had 2 ayahuasca sessions in Costa Rica with a Colombian shaman and wanted to deepen my experience. I came to a retreat center in Peru. 

The Peruvian ceremonies are different than the Colombian ones. In Peru the ceremony ends at 12:30-1 while the Colombian one ends in the morning.

I had my first ceremony and a very confusing ceremony with a lot of thoughts and some emotional pain. I took the second cup which was a huge mistake.  After the ceremony ended I started panicking because that someone smokes at me and I felt that his bad energy is transferred to me - this had caused me to believe that his problems will be mine. The ceremony ended and I was with some people in the Malloka. I couldn't concentrate and started having hard time breathing, I was panicked. I walked around and went out, locked myself in the bathroom, started yelling and didn't know what to do. It's important to note that I didn't purged and had 2 full cups in me. I was high, barely walking, very drunk and afraid, this was so traumatic for me. I wondered around telling people what had happened to me and they said I should talk to the shaman the next day. I got into more panic and freaked out that my situation is so bad.

Fortunately I got my phone, called home and was guided to drink, purge, I was relaxed that every thing will be alright. Although it was very hard for me to believe in that. I got into the Malloka and waked one of the crew members that was there, she held me almost all night. 

I learned a lot from that bad experience and wasn't sure I'm going to drink again, there was a day of rest in between and I decided to go for a half cup the next ceremony. So I did, had a great ceremony with good visions, although not very insightful in relation to my situation. Again the ceremony ended, I felt lonely but this time the crew member that also drank ayahuasca was with me. I got into panic again worried about my mother as if something might happen to her, again, this is a very old fear I have. The panic started again for 4 hours of negative thinking loops, hard time breathing, feeling lonely and lost. I had to get my phone again and send her a text to realize she's OK. 

The third ceremony I visions that bad spirits are attacking me. Had a bad ceremony,  zero concentration, I couldn't vision or listen to the Icaros. The ceremony ended and again panic attack, I felt that the guys in the Malloka will attack me or that someone will come from the jungle. One of the guys really triggered me by saying a lot of crap because he was drunk as well. I stayed up until 6am. I couldn't sleep. I panicked, felt lonely and resisted to fall a sleep as I was sure I'm going to be attacked. I was so afraid.

I don't know why I keep getting these panic attacks. That's out of the ceremony. 
I don't feel safe at the center. Some of the people are very negative, talk about dark magic and I'm a newbie that only wants to heal. 

I made a huge mistake coming here, and now I'm leaving. I don't know what to do, should I avoid Ayahuasca or go to a better center with better security, support and help? 

In the center I was in there was only support from the translator who drank ayahuasca herself. This is not a proper support though I had luck because we bonded and she really focused me. The last ceremony she was too high after ceremony and could barely assist me. I felt like I'm waiting for morning to arrive but there were 5 hours till light come up. I was dead scared. I feel quite traumatized from these ceremonies and I decided to leave. 

Is there hope in Ayahuasca for me? I'm not sure if I'm supposed to give up or go to a place I will feel secure in. I might still get panicked, which is very frustrating because it is not helping my process, it doesn't help process the trauma or to resolve the fears. 

Is it possible to totally resolve an inner fear/belief using Ayahuasca?

The abstract, published in the April/May issue of *The Journal of Addictive Medicine,* states:

&gt;Benzodiazepines are a controversial treatment for anxiety in patients with substance use disorders. Concerns include risk of addiction, overdose, and diversion. But **benzodiazepines are among the most effective and well-tolerated treatments for anxiety, and are safe for the majority of patients who take them.** Though not appropriate for all cases, particularly in those with an active opioid use disorder, **benzodiazepines should be considered as a treatment for patients with substance use disorders after careful weighing of benefits and harms.**

I don't have a copy of the full article yet as it is embargoed for another 6 months-1 year through my database access system. I would love to read the entire article, however, and hope to do so in the future. The abstract itself is, however, quite clear. Edit: I now have a copy of the entire article.

The conclusions of the above article are at odds with the long-standing, but recently intensified, ""push"" to suggest that benzodiazepine use should be reduced or ended in many anxiety patients, a practice which has lead to many anxiety patients to be either stigmatized or denied this class of medication. **The article clearly advocates for the safety of benzodiazepines and states that they are the best medication for anxiety for most human beings, including some who have substance use issues.**

The first kind I saw were like black silhouettes, and they loved mapacho. In particular, they asked for mapacho and help me in various ways after I smoke mapacho. They'd sometimes untie tensions in me or answer questions. They once massaged me and cleaned me after I smoked mapacho.

The second kind where more colourful and thinner, and they kind of didn't have any body language (they weren't dull or unemotional, but rather unreadable). Unlike the black silhouette ones, these ones didn't help me in any particular way. Once, they'd simply crawl deep in me to uncover some memories.

I purchased Banisteriopsss Capi, Psychotria Viridis and Mimosa Hostilis online and I'll be cooking the brew myself (opted for Psychotria and not Mimosa after some reading).

I believe the time has come for me to have my first psychedelic experience, but I would like to do it in the most ideal way possible. Unfortunately, I can't afford a trip to a South American country or hiring a local shaman (doubt there are any in the island where I live), so I'll have to do it at home ""on my own"" (will have someone watching after me).

I started consuming cannabis two years ago (I'm 28) and it changed my life. It showed me a different ""vibration"" or ""frequency"", basically another reality, another way of living. Since then, meditation , Qi Gong and many other ""spiritual"" or non conventional stuff are now part of my life. I basically started awakening.

I have seen first hand how intentions and feelings affect plants and water, how one can really co-create reality and effect it, and I believe I can take on this journey alone at this moment of my life. To me this is personal and spiritual growth, not recreational ""drug"" use.

Could you guide me a little bit on how to carry on this practice / perform a ""DIY ritual"" at home?

Have been taking Lexapro for about 1.5 months.
There's an ayahuasca ceremony I would like to attend next week. 
I stopped taking Lexapro as soon as I learned about this. 
Have done tons of research and the general consensus is that Lexapro + ayahuasca = you can die.... 

However I don't have a clear understanding on how long should I be off Lexapro in order to safely experience Ayahuasca.

Based on the information that Lexapro has a half life of 27 to 32 hours (meaning every 27 to 32 hours the levels of the med are reduced by half in the system)...

After 7 days off a 10mg daily dose, math tells me (via the half life equation) that I will still have between .27 and .52 MG in my system (that's between 3-5% of a single dose).  

Is that a sustancial amount to be worried about?

I'm experiencing changa so I know it may be different from some of your experiences. But I was curious how long journeyers here usually wait to integrate their experiences before journeying again.

The reason I ask is because it was such a monumental experience that even three weeks later I'm processing and integrating my experience. It seems like ideally once a half year is right but because of my circumstances I plan to do it once a month for a total of 3 journeys as I don't wish to overstay my welcome and that seems to be the right number of times from my one experience.

1149,"[This a summary of a 2012 publication by Liester &amp; Prickett](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23061319) which offers four hypotheses to explain mechanisms by which ayahuasca may exert antiaddictive properties. They categorize the effects of ayahuasca into four groups: biochemical, physiological, psychological, and transcendent. Matching these categories are four theories regarding the therapeutic mechanism of ayahuasca, one for each level of effects.

---

-

**1) Biochemical Theory**

-

&gt; Hypothesis #1: Ayahuasca exerts its antiaddictive properties by reducing brain dopamine levels in the mesolimbic pathway. This occurs via ayahuasca’s effects on serotonin receptors.

-

I won’t go into much detail on the biochemical mechanisms of ayahuasca in this post, as the science gets pretty dense and deserves a separate discussion. There are a number of publications that discuss the biochemical mechanisms of psychedelics, and I intend to review some of this work in the future, but for now I’ll keep it simple. 

Addiction is highly dependent on the reward system in the brain, a system mainly utilizing the neurotransmitter dopamine. All addictive drugs, to some extent, exert direct or indirect effects on the dopamine reward system – it is this interaction that is the primary driver of addiction. There’s growing evidence that ayahuasca actually inhibits, or reduces, dopaminergic activity in the reward center of the brain. This action on the dopamine system may lessen neural associations of reward, including those underlying drug addiction.

Ayahuasca may also provide a somewhat natural and persisting antidepressant effect through its actions on the serotonin system.

---

-

**2) Physiological Theory**

-

&gt;Hypothesis #2: Reduced dopamine levels in the mesolimbic pathway associated with ayahuasca interfere with the synaptic plasticity associated with the development and maintenance of addictions.

-

This level of inquiry moves general chemical interactions into specific neural circuitry. This is outside the scope of this post, though I do review several veins of neurophysiological research in other posts.

---

-

**3) Psychological Theory**

-

&gt;Hypothesis #3: Ayahuasca treats addictions by helping resolve traumas, encourage the understanding of potential outcomes of choices, and improving decision-making.

-

Here, the authors refer back to early LSD research on alcoholism, noting the importance of psychoanalysis and psychological integration. Psychedelics allow for deeply embedded emotional patterns which may remain largely unconscious and unresolved to be experienced consciously, creating an opportunity to work through and dissolve emotional baggage. As with all psychiatric illnesses, one’s suppressed emotional state is a major part of the development of addictions. 

To quote the article:

&gt; Ayahuasca is also believed to help individuals heal traumas by allowing them to recognize how past experiences have influenced present-day experiences. Furthermore, it is believed that ayahuasca gives individuals an opportunity to experience the potential future outcomes of their choices, including the choice to use alcohol and/or illicit drugs.

---

-

**4) Transcendent Theory**

-

&gt;Hypothesis #4: ayahuasca treats addictions by facilitating transcendent experiences.

-

Transcendent experiences have been reported by many to be helpful in overcoming addiction - the lack of spirituality in the biomedical model was a motivating factor for AA cofounder Bill W. The use of transcendent experiences for healing is not at all new; it is among the most ancient forms of healing known.

It seems to have been pushed aside be Western society, but may be making a comeback in the guise of psychedelic research. [Another example](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25563443) of recent research discussing the significance of ‘mystical experience’ comes out of Johns Hopkins, looking at psilocybin for tobacco addiction.

Participants of a [novel observational study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23627784) looking at ayahuasca for addiction also reported the spiritual quality of the experience to be crucial for the therapeutic effects. They reported experiences of increased connection to self, to other, and to spirit/nature, as well as improvements in measures of quality of life, and these changes were sustained for six months.

-

---

-

**Conclusion**

-

To those who have experienced the powerful effects of ayahuasca, all of this might seem kind of obvious. This work is valuable, however, in its formal contribution to the growing body of psychedelic and entheogenic research. Future work can expand on these concepts, investigating different aspects of each therapeutic dimension.

This study also informs the western biomedical or biopsychosocial conceptualizations of illness and treatment. Several observational studies emphasize the importance of the spiritual domain of healing. It is worth giving more attention to these matters to develop more effective treatments.

1151,"Here's a great paper I came across awhile back and have been trying to spread:

[The Therapeutic Potentials of Ayahuasca: Possible Effects against Various Diseases of Civilization](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4773875/)

It's fairly long and technical but there's a lot of great info, here's the part I find most interesting:

&gt; we concluded that the function of DMT may extend central nervous activity and involve a more universal role in cellular protective mechanisms. We provided converging evidence that while DMT is a substance which produces powerful psychedelic experiences, it is better understood not as a hallucinogenic drug of abuse, but rather an agent of significant adaptive mechanisms like neuroprotection, neuroregeneration, and immunity.

&gt;Nevertheless, immunoregulation by DMT is a bidirectional process. Sig-1Rs are expressed together with 5-HT receptors in immune cells conveying both inflammatory and anti-inflammatory signals (Szabo, 2015). These receptors are essential in the “fine-tuning” of innate and adaptive immune responses. Human clinical studies showed that ayahuasca can alter the number and distribution of blood immune cells in a way that can increase the antiviral and anti-tumor immunity of the consumer (reviewed in Frecska et al., 2013). Ayahuasca also influences the distribution of lymphocyte subpopulation: CD4 lymphocytes decrease and the number of natural killer cells increase significantly with time (dos Santos et al., 2012). The possible anti-cancer activity of the decoction makes it a promising candidate for further researches in novel pharmacotherapies (Schenberg, 2013). Furthermore, DMT may also be an adaptogen increasing the survival rate of neurons or other cell types during acute hypoxia or under chronic oxidative stress.",Ayahuasca,"The Therapeutic Potentials of Ayahuasca, study"

I briefly went through this paper to understand the pharmacological difference between agonists and antagonists, but I'm still having understanding why two different molecules that bind to the same receptor produce vastly different effects. Could my fellow redditors help me out?

EDIT: These are some fascinating responses that certainly helped me in finding answers! Here's a direct quote from the Wikipedia article on functional selectivity:

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_selectivity
""One notable example of functional selectivity occurs with the 5-HT2A receptor, as well as the 5-HT2C receptor. Serotonin, the main endogenous ligand of 5-HT receptors, is a functionally selective agonist at this receptor, activating phospholipase C (which leads to inositol triphosphate accumulation), but does not activate phospholipase A2, which would result in arachidonic acid signalling. However, the other endogenous compound dimethyltryptamine activates arachidonic acid signaling at the 5-HT2A receptor, as do many exogenous hallucinogens such as DOB and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). Notably, LSD does not activate IP3 signaling through this receptor to any significant extent. Oligomers; specifically 5-HT2A–mGluR2 heteromers mediate this effect. This may explain why some direct 5-HT2 receptor agonists have psychedelic effects, whereas compounds that indirectly increase serotonin signalling at the 5-HT2 receptors, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), generally do not; nor do 5HT2A receptor agonists without constitutive activity at the mGluR dimer, such as lisuride.""

So it appears that different ligands trigger different downstream signaling cascades in the cell. This is really interesting!

1155,"I have had Ayahuasca in the back of my mind for the past 3 years ever since I went through a divorce, dealing with addiction, and a number of other things. The call has always been there ever since and nagging at me on a daily basis. Fast forward to now, here I am going through another breakup due to my issues. Days after the breakup about a week ago I tell myself it's time. I reach out to a retreat center and start the booking/planning process. But I ended up sitting on it for a few days and not putting in the deposit. The whole time getting overly anxious about it all. I couldn't pull the trigger and was constantly coming up with every excuse I could. However most of it was just fear. Fear of who I would become. Fear of what might happen. Fear of making things worse. Fear of what my friends and family might think. Fear of wasting money. It also didn't help flight tickets climbed a significant amount. But I kept trying to tell myself ""iIt's jsut money and this is a experience of a lifetime"".

However, that link leads to a dead URL now and if you look at the search function, that retreat center is no longer on ayaadvisors despite continuing to operate and advertize elsewhere.

Seems to me that as resources that are prominently recommended on this website, we should make it a bit more transparent the politics behind the website and how these centers get listed. Like restaurants on Yelp/Airbnb, some are perhaps paying to move up in the rankings only to then get recommendations based off these rankings - a vicious cycle that creates a few powerful players who have a racket on the ayahausca retreat industry.

I think it's important for us to ask or discuss the criteria exist as to what retreat centers appear or which do not? Do you need to pay to be added? Can a center be removed and why? (Wouldn't it be better to continue to let the school exist with negative reviews if something was wrong?)

There are many questions to be answered and I think there are beholden interests that I think we should discuss for the sake of transparency's sake.

1178,"I've tried to understand/resolve my brain chemistry crisis in every way I know how, and I simply can't figure it out - and am suffering as a result. I'll try to be as brief as possible while still providing detail.

&amp;#x200B;

On Tuesday I'll celebrate 1 year away from hard drugs and alcohol. I was a horrible heroin addict (as well as many other substances). But frankly, my recovery is at more risk than ever because of this mess I find myself in.

&amp;#x200B;

Over the past 6 or so months I've seen chemicals stop having their supposed affect on my brain. It's freaking bizarre. It's like medication affecting my brain doesn't work like it used to. This is *especially* true of stimulants which is a major problem but virtually *nothing* is working like it's supposed to.

&amp;#x200B;

Here are chemicals I know for sure have pretty much quit working:

&amp;#x200B;

**Caffeine -** I'm an occasional coffee drinker. It's always been almost too overwhelming. Two days ago I  drank 8 cups of coffee in a row just to see if it would affect me. Nothing.

**Adderall/Ritalin** \- I have some pretty serious learning disabilities. I do need this medication for focus but I'll be honest...I count on this stuff for motivation, especially in dealing with post acute withdrawal syndrome. I've taken it for decades and I know what tolerance looks/feels like and that's not what this is. Furthermore, I've done all kinds of things - taking breaks, switching from Adderall to Ritalin and vice versa, taking 9-me-bc which everyone swears immediately reverses their tolerance, etc. (The first two of these things worked in the past when I did develop a tolerance.)

**Psilocybin** **&amp; LSD (Microdoses)** \- I hadn't micro-dosed for 6 months. I just got some psilocybin that I know is legit. But when I take it? Absolutely nothing

**Tianteptine** \- Worked for a while, then it stopped. I've taken long breaks...and nothing.

**Phenibut** \- Also doesn't work after very long breaks.

**Antidepressants** \- This I'm less certain about because it would have been gradual but I have felt horrible lately. (See below)

&amp;#x200B;

Medications/Supplements I take:

Lexapro 20mg

Subutex (Buprenorphine) 16mg

Buproprion 150mg

Lion's Mane

Mementine 7.5mg (tapering up)

L-Tyrosine

\*Was Taking Serequel 150mg for sleeep...think this may be the culprit?

&amp;#x200B;

In addition to medications not working, I feel *so* apathetic. I literally have zero motivation to do anything and simply don't care about things that I always have. Getting myself to do simple things - things I used to enjoy - is nearly impossible. Which is not good for my recovery *at all*.

&amp;#x200B;

My possible theories:

&amp;#x200B;

I was taking too much serequil (it's what the doctor told me to take) and that messed up my dopamine system. The thing is - I've stopped that medication for over 6 weeks and I still have the problems, yet the half-life is really short.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I'm wondering if the buprenorphine is causing problems? It's a higher dose than I've taken in the past. I'm actually taking less than 16mg these days bc I'm tapering down but I was at that dose for a long time.

&amp;#x200B;

When it comes to adderall/ritalin, it's not like the medication doesn't work *at all*. My heart rate is increased (I have an Apple watch that tracks it), especially later in the day. But I don't get any improvement in focus, motivation, energy, etc. It's so bizarre. I also noticed the effectiveness of the medication decrease over time, especially noticing that it would be later in the day before it was effective at all.

&amp;#x200B;

Could there be some kind of imbalance that would affect all medications that affect my brain? If so, what could it be and what can I do about it?

&amp;#x200B;

I don't care about the phenibut or tianeptine not working. It's just an example of other compounds that have no affect even though I don't have a tolerance to them. I'm just scared something is really wrong with my brain and I *have* to get out of this funk where I have zero enthusiasm. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you so much ahead of time...any ideas/suggestions would be super appreciated. I can provide more details/context on any of this.

1180,"**- Foreword**

If you have been following this subreddit for a few years, you might have seen me here. I do not study neuropharmacology as a profession, and I do research in another field. My passion for this field is completely self-driven as a hobby. If you wonder what I actually research in, googling my username would give it give away.

If anyone of do you indeed follow me closely, I actually posted a study that I personally published on PubMed a while ago, regarding to benzodiazepines, however, to keep the space between online/real-life, I won't say which author I was and which paper exactly that I posted.
_______________________________________________________________________________________________

**- Introduction and method.**

This study was planned to be published as a short communication of an online survey of people that have cross used benzodiazepines and psychedelics. I am too busy in the other field I work in, so I give up trying to type up a grammatically-non-triggering paper with a bunch of citation and useless introductions no one will read. Posting here benefits drug nerds more than anywhere else since this is my ultimate target audience. 

This survey was conducted online, most of the participants came form sub-reddits similar to r/drugnerds but not on r/drugnerd itself. This survey was also designed to be as simple and as fast as possible, due to the short attention spam of reddit users. This study was conducted around Feburary-March 2018.
_______________________________________________________________________________________________

**- Survey Results.**

83 Participant (77 Male and 6 Female) took this survey. of these, 78 People (94%) of which reported cross-use of LSD along with other drugs. 

Of these 78 people, 66 people (79.5%) reporting attempting to take an anti-anxiety agent to attempt to either prevent or stop a bad experience (bad trip).

Of the above, the number of people who took anti-anxiety agent either before, during, or after the psychedelic trip was about even, however, the majority took the anti-anxiety agent during psychedelic use.

37 (44.58%) out of all the 83 participants who still made it here, reported taking benzodiazepine class drugs with psychedelics drugs. 19.2% reported using cannabis, 9.6% reported drinking alcohol, 6% reported using phenibut, 4.8% reported using MDMA, 2.4% reported using Gabapentinoids, 1.2% reported using Z-drugs, and finally, 12.05% reported taking other than what was on the list.

56 of all the above 83 participants completely the survey regarding their anxiety levels before cross-using LSD with their other choice of substance. Of these 53 people, 20 of which were the people that originally reported benzodiazepine as their choice of anti-anxiety medication, while during the psychedelic experience to stop a bad trip.

Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) scale were used to assess participant's anxiety levels before and after taking their choice of substance.  However only the anxiety scale was used since the assessment of depression was not a part of the original intention of the study.

HADS-A Before taking benzodiazepines: 12.95  (Standard dev = 3.4)
HADS-A After taking benzodiazepines: 2.6 (Standard dev= 2.5)
Significance level P&lt;0.0001

The maximum score for this test is 21, and the least is 0. 
Hospitals consider a score of 0-7 as normal levels of anxiety, 8-10 as borderline normal, and above 11 as abnormal.

This survey also noted that, in these 20 people, the dosage of benzodiazepine did not significantly affect the level of reduction of the visual, audio, visually-distorting, spiritual, blissful, and insightful effects of LSD. People who took 0.5mg Lorazepam seemed to report equivalent high levels of LSD-effect diminishing than someone who took 2mg of Alprazolam, while others who took the same quantity reported no diminishing effects took place at all (other than anxiety).

_______________________________________________________________________________________________

**- Summary / TLDR**

In this 7 minute survey of 83 participants who took LSD, 78 have taken LSD in combinations with other drugs. 37 of these 78 of which reported taking benzodiazepine to reduce anxiety during the psychedelic experience, and finally 20 of the 37 finished the entire survey.

HADS Anxiety scale showed an extremely benefiting effect of benzodiazepine for LSD-induced anxiety (p=0.0001), and the amount diminishing of visual-audio distorting effects from LSD as a result of taking benzodiazepines appear to be individual-difference, and not dosage-dependent.

1184,"Hey everyone. This is a tad bit dense, so I put asterisks \(\*\) in place to improve readability. Thank you for taking the time to read :\)

\*

To start, I'm a 17\-year\-old boy living in southern California. I have parents who care for me and provide MORE than enough for me. I have friends who love me. I have family who would die for me. I live in a beautiful beach town.

\*

However, since the age of around 13\-14, I've had a profound sense of something 'missing'. It's manifested itself in me becoming more and more numb to and disconnected from life and those around me.

\*

This feeling has been festering in me, building up upon itself perpetually, forcing myself to frantically search for a solution or at least a cause to what's happened to me.

\*

These solutions have ranged from taking psychedelics such as LSD or mushrooms \(albeit in small doses\), to meditation, to exercising constantly, to eating perfectly, to doing good for others, to therapy, to trying to change my thought processes. Nothing has yielded ANY results \- in fact, they've only made my condition worse, building upon the incessant anxiety burning inside of me.

\*

Recently, I've been looking into the possibility of mental illnesses. First depression, then anxiety, then ADHD, then bipolar. I've been going in maddening circles, seeking diagnosis or treatment, with no results.

\*

However, tonight I watched a documentary \(The Last Shaman\) which made me come to a host of paramount realizations about myself and my place in the Western world.

\*

First off, I'd like to report that I realized simply getting an ADHD diagnosis then taking medication for the rest of my life would mean the denial of myself and what I'm meant for \(if anything\). If ADHD is the inability to do things you don't enjoy, can this not be a blessing? Why would I lead a life filled with pointless things? I refer to the story of the fisherman \([http://paulocoelhoblog.com/2015/09/04/the\-fisherman\-and\-the\-businessman/](http://paulocoelhoblog.com/2015/09/04/the-fisherman-and-the-businessman/)\). Why go to school and work for the rest of my life? What the fuck does that accomplish? We all have everything we need to be happy. I do not want to lead a life that is not living, which will happen if I take ADHD medication and force myself to conform to who society, and unfortunately my mother, want me to be, ultimately leading to an extremely unfulfilled life.

\*

Secondly, depression and anxiety \(and even ADHD!\) are not simply chemical imbalances that need to be corrected with a pill that will make you feel better. They are the results of an unhealthy external environment. Our minds tell us when something is wrong around us, as they've been finely\-tuned over millions of years to do so, and sequestering these indications from our bodies will also lead to an unfulfilled and/or unhappy life. Therefore medications that address the symptoms, and not causes, will destroy what makes us human.

\*

Third, there are mental blockages and defense mechanisms that were put in place to protect myself from some extreme fighting that went on incessantly and relentlessly in my family for as long as I can remember. Obviously, these energies are no longer serving me, and I would like to remove them. I know for a fact that nothing will remove them except for a strong, consistent meditation practice or a strong psychedelic trip into my own mind. I honestly elect for the latter due to the fact that my soul has been and still is being drained of energy from the box that I'm being forced to in school and modern life everyday.

\*

This is where ayahuasca comes in. It is the medication that shows us the causes of the illness and allows us to fix them. It does not silence or hide our problems; rather, it shines the spotlight on them which allow us to confront and fix them ourselves.

\*

I am mentally sick with depression and chronic anxiety from my environment, and medicating myself with little\-understood, man\-made medicines will mean the denial of my nature. Even ignoring my feelings of depression that come from living in modern society out of fear that something bad will happen if I pack my bags and leave will create an unfulfilled life for me. If I don't take the leap to change my situation, I'll be a zombie for the rest of my life. I don't belong in what man has created, I belong in what the universe has created for us.

\*

What do I do? I am legitimately thinking about dropping out and leaving it all behind. I think I'll be happier lying on my death bed knowing I did that. I have fear that it will seriously negatively affect the mental health of my family, but is it worth it? I have so many questions and feelings of dissatisfaction, discontentment, emptiness, and despair, that something HAS to change, but I don't know what it's going to be. All I know is I cannot, or absolutely SHOULD NOT, go through the motions and live a lie like I've been doing my whole life. Do I let my mother's fears hold me back? Do I let mine hold me back?

\*

1192,"I have experience with mescaline, LSA, mushrooms etc. I decided to try ayahuasca recently. At 9pm on a full moon, I drank a brew of 50g yellow ceilo Caapi after fasting for 24hr+. After about an hour and a half I ate a small amount of Chaliponga leaf. Just swallowed the shredded leaf with some water. 

Within 10mins, my hands began to sweat, everything got much louder and brighter and the room looked very different. As I laid down, there was a feeling of my body being pulled and contorted, almost like my body was made of dough and I was being kneeded. 

Then I started to spin, in one direction faster and faster, until my consciousness condensed into a shiny metallic-looking object and as I begin spinning faster and faster, I started to hear a loud humming sound, followed by my consciousness bursting through my body and beginning to levitate upwards. There was a feeling of forward acceleration, very similar to being on a roller coaster. 

I closed my eyes and in the blackness I saw a glass-like object being blown up with light and energy like a balloon, stretching bigger and bigger until it exploded, releasing rays of pure light of all different colors, along with millions of metallic-glass like shards going in every which direction, with what looked like billions and billions of sparkling, brilliant colored, fully-cut gemstones, all cut exactly the same way and similar in shape and size bursting forth from the balloon like object, scattering everywhere and raining down. 

Brilliant red rubies, glowing green emeralds, blue sapphires and diamonds. The majority of them being rubies and sapphires, all raining down in the black vacuum of empty space.

There were simple representations, or symbols, of flowers. They where made of thin, hollow, clear tubes filled with glowing, intensely colored light. Almost like a thinner version of the neon tubes you see on signs. Blue, red, and pink petals. Green stems and leaves. Some flowers were colors I have never seen before in my life. The flowers and their vines were growing and blooming over and over again, like it was breathing. They would spread out, bloom, recede and repeat that pattern over and over. 

I also had clear recollections of learning to walk and talk. I travelled back to my past and relived memories starting from preschool and moving forward in time to the present, identifying and learning from mistakes and traumas.

Towards the end of the experience, I saw something I find difficult to describe with language or by any other means. The closest thing I can come up with is ‘textured sentient light’. It would transform in front of me and communicated through emotions.

It was an amazingly transformative, life-changing experience that lasted 14+ hrs, although it felt subjectively, like much longer. I feel like I learned a lot about myself and the universe we all share. Interestingly enough, I did not purge, although I could feel the serotonin building up and making me nauseous.

1199,"I said i'd post a trip report. here goes.

I drink my MAOI at 9:00 mountain time. Once finished i wait 10 minutes before i begin drinking my DMT/datura and it is actually easier to get down as the vinegar masks the taste of river plant.

I begin to feel nauseous and calm, I feel it is kicking in, I look out my window and the trees in my neighbors backyard (I dont have any) are taking on an ""organic machinery"" appearance which is something i've seen occur on all my psychedelic experiences at my home. The city lights aren't re-organizing themselves into fractals, but they are shimmering and seem much brighter than the usually do.

The nausea dissipates and I head to my dark room, as I walk in a feel a slight comfortable fuzzy body-high. I put on some shpongle and I lay down on my bed, closing my eyes. There are definite CEV's however they are incredibly mild. Normally when sober reaching a meditative state I can see images, however in this state I can't instead mild fractals. I check the time and it's 11:30.

My thoughts seem slightly sped-up and more abstract but nonetheless not in a psychedelic head-space I'm used to. I notice my curtain drifting very slightly as well as the corners within my room. The body-high has definitely increased in intensity and is quite comforting.

I decide to try and meditate as that was something I wanted to try while intoxicated. I close my eyes, allow my mind to wander and let go. I get into a meditative state incredibly easily. After a while I open my eyes and feel even more tranquil than before, I check the time and it is 12:00. I realized I probably wasn't going to trip like I wanted but it's alright, I'll always have more opportunities to trip. 

I lay in bed with no music attempting to fall asleep, I accidentally get into a meditative state and have some difficulty falling asleep. I had a dream and woke up, I check the time it's 1:30 and I forgot the dream. This occurs probably 4-5 more times and now it's 9:20 as I'm typing this up and I feel very calm, zen, and refreshed.

All in all it wasn't terrible, just not what I was hoping would occur. I think it was underwhelming because the number on how much DMT is in P. Arundinicae is incorrect. It says out of 100g's of plant matter they acquired 60mg of DMT. Their percentage said 0.06% DMT which would mean the should've only gotten 6mgs. Six milligrams seems much more realistic than sixty. Oh well, next time I make ayahuasca I'll find a better MAOI (probabaly russian olive) and use much much more than 35g's of P. Arundinicae and I'll let you guys know how that goes. 

Goodluck guys, have fun, and be safe! &lt;3 much love

1207,"I've been doing research on the dangers of inhaling Nitrous Oxide (recreationally, as it's my understanding that dentist-administration of nitrous takes precautions to ensure safety). It's pretty clear that nitrous can cause hypoxia (oxygen deprivation to the brain), and I hypothesize that there are (2) possible causes for it:

1. Pure N2O, when inhaled directly, reacts with oxygen in the bloodstream to produce a byproduct which is NOT oxygen, and seeing as pure N2O contains a much higher molar content than the small amount of oxygen in the blood, O2 is the limiting reactant, and becomes replaced with leftover N2O and the byproduct. This means that N2O itself is depleting oxygen in your blood (and thus your brain).
2. This one is simpler. When you inhale pure N2O, you're not inhaling oxygen (by logic), which causes oxygen deprivation (simply from lack of breathing). In this case, N2O isn't bad itself, but NOT inhaling oxygen is bad.

I'm looking for a legitimate chemical explanation for the dangers of recreational N2O consumtion. It's my understanding that if the dangers of N2O are due to (1), than any amount of recreational N2O inhalation is bad. However, if (2) is true, then recreational use of N2O isn't dangerous in small amounts, because it would be essentially as dangerous as holding your breath for a little.

1209,"I've done aya a couple of times. I can understand that it's very easy to sacralise some aspects of maybe actually the most trascendental event a human being can experience, at any time in history and on the whole planet. But to me, although i can understand it, it doesn't make it more respectable in an 'abstract' or 'philosophical' way.

In practical terms, i'm sure that purging can be a wonderful feeling, an experience that can help you in a myriad of ways, and many people can agree that it's a positive part of the experience, usually. However, i think that there is a part of dogma in this that many don't realise.

Have you ever listened to Shpongle on LSD? Or some other trippy music? I bet many of you have. And it's great, isn't it? In fact, every time i talk about LSD trips, i recommend heavily to people to listen music in it. But even if i do it, i know that there's not a single and correct way to trip on LSD, and that people shouldn't be 'forced' to listen to music on LSD.

Every person is different, and every circumstance is unique. This universe is huge and full of things happening and people experiencing different problems and ways of life. People's experiences on Ayahuasca shouldn't be tunneled through a concise spiritual and aesthetic way or subculture, methinks. Personally, all the times I've done Ayahuasca i've purged and sometimes it has helped, sometimes it has been a bad and and really unnecessary feeling. It depends.

Also, while i'm tired of certain aspects of western medicine and science-making, which i consider too cold and unintuitive, when i see some people talk about whatever properties ayahuasca has in the body, especially related to purging and toxins and whatever, i can't help but roll my eyes a bit. It's like, that's not how the body works, dude. 

I hope i can take ayahuasca at some points in pill form/without tannins/etc. Have an experience without the body discomfort. And i say this saying that i know, have read and talked about all the theories and philosophies about how all this is necessary and etc.

It feels like wearing a new pair of shoes you are trying to break in. 1/2 the time it feels like I still have jet lag (maybe I do?) and am living in a dream and the other half the time it feels like the volume on reality has been turned down and my thoughts are super clear and I am finding it very easy to compartmentalize, while feeling everything. It feels like I am in 2 places at once sometimes-one is the place I am, and one is the tumultuous world, that I am protected from.

I suspect that physical extremes and ""high information density"" regions (such as the center of a star (or possibly even a planet) with high pressure and temperature) may be worthwhile candidates to investigate as potentially containing something that we may be able to think of as consciousness.

1245,"I've been posting a lot here recently. I am going to be participating in my first three Ayahuasca ceremonies in only a month now. I've been having a lot of thoughts about my whole life recently, and I really need help. This is going to be a lengthy post, but I need to get everything out since I don't know how else I am going to be able to get my thoughts out there.

I am 18 years old (turning 19 in March), and when I was younger I used to be a somewhat sociable person. Maybe not quite as sociable as everyone else, but definitely not as reserved as I am now. My childhood was somewhat rough, but it definitely could have been worse. I have memories from when I was four or five years old, coming downstairs in the middle of the night and seeing my mom passed out drunk on the floor. This happened a lot, as she was abusing alcohol a lot. The first time this happened I thought she was dead, and went to the neighbors for help. Needless to say, she wasn't the best mother growing up, but she had her reasons, and I don't blame her. She suffered extreme sexual and physical abuse from her father when she was a kid, so I know she is suffering a lot too. Anyway, her neglectfulness eventually led to my father taking custody over my sister and I.

So when my dad took custody of my sister and I, I was in first grade at this time. Looking back, I definitely think I was damaged, but not nearly to the point where I am now. I was a very overly sensitive kid. I cried a lot over little things, had a very short temper, and was overall pretty emotionally unstable. Still, I was able to develop and maintain some friendships. I was very close with three other kids my age that lived in the neighborhood.

In fifth grade, I witnessed another traumatizing event that deeply effected me. First, a little backstory for context. When my dad first took custody over my sister and I, he had been dating a girl that he really liked. My sister and I liked her too. She really took the place of a mother figure that my biological mother was too unstable to do at the time. Eventually, my dad married this woman, and life was looking pretty decent. Well, in fifth grade, on the very first day of Thanksgiving break, something happened that no one was prepared for. I woke up on that morning, and walked out of my room to head to the bathroom. On my way there, I walked past my father's room. The door was opened, and my step-mother's dead body was on the ground. My dad was over her body, on the phone with the police, totally freaking out. She had died from a brain aneurysm at some point the night prior. This was one of the most horrific things I've ever witnessed. What was worse than seeing my step-mother's lifeless corpse, was seeing the immense fear and panic on my dad's face. I've never seen him like that before.

The months that followed were really difficult for me. There wasn't really anyone for me to talk to at the time. I just tried to forget about it, and I feel like for this reason I never fully processed it. My father would have these terrifying outbursts of anger at times where he would throw furniture at the walls around the house while screaming really loudly. There was one occasion in which he got physical with me, which was probably the most scared I've ever been with my dad. Now, don't get me wrong, my father isn't normally an abusive person. In the past, he was normally much more chill compared to other parents, but the mental state he was in really changed him.

About a year after this happened, I began to withdraw from my friends. I never talked to anyone unless I absolutely had to. My routine was to wake up, go to school, get home, then spend the rest of the day in solitude before going to bed. Part of me was hoping my friends would realize something was going on, and would check on me, but they never seemed to care. I know I should have just directly asked for help, but it was really difficult for me at the time. I completely withdrew from society for about two years. In this time I had gotten into some very damaging behavior such as self harm. I even got suspended twice for losing my temper and becoming violent with bullies.

At the end of this withdrawal period, I realized how much the lonliness was getting to me, and attempted to reintegrate myself back into my friend group. They accepted me back kind of quickly, and I still hang out with them to this day, but things have never been the same as they were before, and they most likely never will. They are all social people who are able to make friends and talk to girls easily, but I am riddled with social anxiety and possibly Aspergers (according to my therapist), leaving me totally unable to socialize without being awkward and making people uncomfortable. My friends have on multiple occasions told me that I am likely going to die alone if I don't stop being awkward, and one of them has even told them that they don't believe in me. This type of stuff truly pains me. They have no respect for me at all whatsoever.

I've been sitting here today thinking about everything, and I feel like I am too far gone. I don't even know what it feels like to be normal. I can't imagine how it could even be possible to get better from this. I've had suicidal thoughts before, but I have never felt them this heavily until today. I feel like my only option right now is to kill myself. I don't necessarily want to die, but it's a hell of a lot better than living the rest of my life this broken. I keep thinking about how easy it would be to end all my suffering. I just need to overcome my fear of death, which is slowly becoming easier each day. This is the main reason I'm posting this. I've reached a mental state today that I didn't even know was possible, and it keeps getting worse. At this rate, I know that eventually the day will come where nothing will be able to talk me out of committing suicide.

Now, here's where this becomes about Ayahuasca. Around six months ago, I was introduced to psychedelics. I feel like these have taught me a lot of lessons, but clearly haven't cured me of anything. I mean, look at what I'm posting now. I would say that the biggest thing psychedelics have done for me so far is that they have made me self aware of my behavior. I feel like before, I knew that I was struggling, but didn't realize how mentally ill I truly was. After taking psychedelics, it has become blatantly obvious that something is wrong with me, and I can't ignore it now. I no longer have that blissful ignorance that everyone else is the issue. In a way this is good, because it has shown me that I need to take action, and very quickly.

So, as I stated before, in about a month, I am going to be participating in my first three Ayahuasca ceremonies in Iquitos, Peru. Does this have the potential to help me? Or am I just going to be wasting my money, and then come back here feeling just as hopeless? I really don't want to feel like this anymore. It's unbearable, and I really need help.

1261,"Hey all!

&amp;#x200B;

So up untill this year I have had very little experience with psychedelics. I was then offered to partake in a aya journey in April.

&amp;#x200B;

I was terrified but I did it and had a great journey, I was shown how life is beautiful and fun and just a joke so enjoy it. I felt like I had a purpose and that was to show people life doesn't need to be so serious all the time and humor and love is what we need more of.

&amp;#x200B;

I then was asked if I wanted to do another journey in October so I said yes. This time I took more of the brew and my intention was to clear away fear and really see the purpose of life.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, I had a TERRIBLE journey, I blacked out for much of it, but from what I remember I was stuck between 3 emotions for what seemed like 1000 years . Then the real terrifying thing happened and everything I loved and everyone I loved faded away into nothing and I got brought to somewhere I cant really described. When I was there I just kept asking whats the point of life  why this and why that in till i got somewhere and I was told to stop that I will never understand the point and to Just BE.

&amp;#x200B;

When I came out of the journey I was shocked because I truly felt I was not coming back and that this whole reality is just a video game and a story I created.

The next few days were hell. I felt disassociated from reality and couldn't grasp the point of anything. I couldn't work out see why I needed to work  . I felt uninspired and was filled with a bunch of regret.  I cant see the point of love or needing connection of why we are here, I am stuck in an existential crisis on steroids.

&amp;#x200B;

Over the next few weeks i started to get better day by day

&amp;#x200B;

but then out of no where 35 days after my journey all the same feelings I had when I got out came back,

1262,"To begin, i have treatment resistant depression/anxiety. Im come off all antidepressants and had terrible withdrawl and spent a year in hell coming off clonazapam. Ive been extemely successful in life but had to leave work due to my severe mental health problems. Still im thankful that i never tried to mask my stress with recreational drugs as im afraid of addiction. 

The only other drugs ive tried are weed a handful of times and ecstacy once when i was 12, im now 28. Its only as an adult that i realize i was depressed at 12 and thats why i took ecstacy. Anyway, that one dose was like an eternity of bliss. I have never been as happy in my life as when i tried E. Thats why i never tried it again. I knew it wasnt reality and i never wanted to chase the high. Also the withdrawl from one dose was pretty bad. Anyways, clearly it just masks your problem by thinking all is good in the world whereas i need to confront my problems. 

Weed: the 5 times ive done it, ive had panic, paranoia, HATED the experience of altering my mind but learned an important lesson each and every time.
1. In highschool weed told me to leave my group of friends because they were a bad influence. They are all in jail now so i guess the paranoia was good.
2. I smoked weed again with my now ex husband when i was happy for the first time in my relationship. The one line that kept repeating in my head the whole night was dont have a baby with that man. We wanted to have kids but deep down i didnt trust him. 6 months later he became extemely abusive and i went through hell but finally left him. I thank the fking universe for dodging that bullet.
3. The last time i tried weed i decided to do it alone in my house so i wont be paranoid. I didnt smoke i made a tea. I had a panic attack which i almost called an ambulance over but eventually fought through. All i wanted was for the high to go away. There were a million thoughts going through my head and one crucial thing that came to me was the thought..my childhood wasnt THAT bad and my mom wasnt a terrible mom - i sit here still wondering if thats weed just masking my problems. Hell if it is then ill drink weed tea everyday. Ive come to 2 different conclusions. Either my childhood really wasnt that bad and ive distorted versions of growing up OR weed is trying to save me the pain by masking it all.

In my normal state of mind, i cry everyday from the trauma and pain my mom made me endure. I have severe anger problems due to her and i dont talk to her currently. But my sister who was 5 years older agrees that we went through trauma but loves my mom and is completely stress free/non resentful. 

I think ketamine and weed mask my problems and thats great except it doesnt last long. My doctor wants me to try IV ketamine as a treatment for my treatment resistant depression. Drs dont tell you shit. He never told me the withdrawl id have going off the clonazapam and he says ketamine has no withdrawl. Ive read countless reviews saying otherwise. Also everyone i knew who took ketamine says the good feelings only lasted for a few months. 

I need something to take me through the pain of my past so i can work through it and heal. Ive had crippling anxiety with severe insomnia my whole life and i believe ive repressed the reason for my insomnia. When did it start and why. Masking with drugs will not help me solve my insomnia. 

Lastly, my dr also recommend ECT. I was very suicidal a few months ago and i brought myself out with exercise and meditation. I was in the room about to get ECT and i walked out right before when a friend i met in the mental health hospital told me she went through 40+ sessions and has severe brain damage. Sad that western doctors wont tell you the truth behind these practices.

Thank you for reading. I have been thinking about Ayahuasca for a long time. But i do think my anxiety levels are too high and ill freak out with a bad trip..thats why i think ketamine first...or just start smoking weed everyday but i think ill just become way more anxious. Weed, ketamine, alcohol ALL make my insomnia worse as does everything in life.

1264,"Hello all.

I had my first experiences with ayahuasca this past weekend at a retreat with two ceremonies. The set and setting was very comfortable and nice. The shamans seemed very respectable, knowledgeable and loving. There were 11 of us and 2 facilitators.

My first ceremony was rather uneventful. I purged almost immediately and felt essentially nothing. I fell asleep mid way through the ceremony and had a very deep, dreamless sleep.

My second ceremony was a whole different ballgame.

It started with me intending to keep the medicine down, meditating, focusing on the Icaros, etc. I became very emotional soon after, crying heavily and had some positive revelations about love towards others and my ego. I never purged beyond that during this ceremony.

Soon after this it got very, very confusing. I no longer felt I was in a ceremony but felt like this was just some gathering of friends. I kept getting up and going over to people and talking to them or talking over the icaros and the shaman. At one point I walked to another person and asked if they wanted to hang out outside and listen to music?? I was having a narcissistic psychosis of sorts. At one point viewing myself as some Superman type figure and the whole ceremony revolving around me and the other participants being my family members and I was their father and husband. The females in the ceremony I viewed as my mother and wives (I’m gay in my regular life). I was even perceiving the peoples’ names in the circle as messages to me. I would go back and forth between these grand delusions in my head like everything had secret meaning, and apologizing profusely over and over and over again to everyone out loud. 

I kept acting out like this for a few moments. The other participants were very patient and kind and tried to calm me down. One older male in the group finally sat in front of me and was stern in getting me to breathe and not get up. I viewed him as my father in that moment and he got me to lay down. 

When I was settled down, an enormous wave of embarrassment and shame over how I had behaved fell in. I cringed physically over replaying the moments before and was so confused as why I had just thought and behaved in such a way. I started crying and the shaman came to check on me. I felt like apologizing more and more to everyone. I honestly felt like I had perverted the ceremony with how I had behaved and I felt like everyone was secretly bothered by my antics. They all paid to be there for healing and I was the only one acting like a complete fool, I thought. This is what I was telling myself at least.

It’s been a few days and I’ve been able to process everything a bit. I think this may have some things to do with self-esteem and shame and guilt I’ve been carrying about other situations, but mostly it all still bothers me. I still view it all as extremely confusing and not at all what I thought I would experience. Certain moments keep popping back up and I still have this physical cringe reaction which I’m really trying to dig deeper into.

I know the integration and understanding is going to take time. I’ve been journaling and meditating but I wanted to get some insight from anyone who can help me out.

1277,"Hello,

A few days ago, I did a 3-days retreat. I purged very little by vomiting / oral expulsion, but more by yawning. And, during the third ceremony, mainly by convulsing.

These convulsions are my main concern, because I can't find so many accounts on them on the internet. They were in the forme of raising my chest, and either sighing to release tension, or violently hitting it back on the ground repeatidly. That's very reminiscent of a demoniac possession. I also contracted my limbs, and at some point, I was distorting my face, growling, showing teethes, and sticking my tongue out.

It felt very pleasant to struggle like that. It was like expressing something within that I struggle putting into words. Maybe an emotion, or part of me, that has not received color, or name, or shape, and somehow wants to express itself. I could also control, for a few seconds, these convulsions, through breathing, which made me feel very good.

If I were asked how I feel, I could answer very correctly, the adrenaline of the interruption putting a stop to these convulsions. So they were very manageable. But I guess they were ugly to see.

Towards their ending, I felt reconciliated with the monstruous part within. I felt empowered by that insight, in short.

So my question is: who has an experience of yawning, and more importantly, of convulsions? What do they mean? What kind of energy do they release? Are convulsions related to possession?",Ayahuasca,Convulsions &amp; yawning: what is their meaning?

&amp;#x200B;

On Tuesday I'll celebrate 1 year away from hard drugs and alcohol. I was a horrible heroin addict (as well as many other substances). But frankly, my recovery is at more risk than ever because of this mess I find myself in.

&amp;#x200B;

Over the past 6 or so months I've seen chemicals stop having their supposed affect on my brain. It's freaking bizarre. It's like medication affecting my brain doesn't work like it used to. This is *especially* true of stimulants which is a major problem but virtually *nothing* is working like it's supposed to.

&amp;#x200B;

Here are chemicals I know for sure have pretty much quit working:

&amp;#x200B;

**Caffeine -** I'm an occasional coffee drinker. It's always been almost too overwhelming. Two days ago I  drank 8 cups of coffee in a row just to see if it would affect me. Nothing.

**Adderall/Ritalin** \- I have some pretty serious learning disabilities. I do need this medication for focus but I'll be honest...I count on this stuff for motivation, especially in dealing with post acute withdrawal syndrome. I've taken it for decades and I know what tolerance looks/feels like and that's not what this is. Furthermore, I've done all kinds of things - taking breaks, switching from Adderall to Ritalin and vice versa, taking 9-me-bc which everyone swears immediately reverses their tolerance, etc. (The first two of these things worked in the past when I did develop a tolerance.)

**Psilocybin** **&amp; LSD (Microdoses)** \- I hadn't micro-dosed for 6 months. I just got some psilocybin that I know is legit. But when I take it? Absolutely nothing

**Tianteptine** \- Worked for a while, then it stopped. I've taken long breaks...and nothing.

**Phenibut** \- Also doesn't work after very long breaks.

**Antidepressants** \- This I'm less certain about because it would have been gradual but I have felt horrible lately. (See below)

&amp;#x200B;

Medications/Supplements I take:

Lexapro 20mg

Subutex (Buprenorphine) 16mg

Buproprion 150mg

Lion's Mane

Mementine 7.5mg (tapering up)

L-Tyrosine

\*Was Taking Serequel 150mg for sleeep...think this may be the culprit?

&amp;#x200B;

In addition to medications not working, I feel *so* apathetic. I literally have zero motivation to do anything and simply don't care about things that I always have. Getting myself to do simple things - things I used to enjoy - is nearly impossible. Which is not good for my recovery *at all*.

&amp;#x200B;

My possible theories:

&amp;#x200B;

I was taking too much serequil (it's what the doctor told me to take) and that messed up my dopamine system. The thing is - I've stopped that medication for over 6 weeks and I still have the problems, yet the half-life is really short.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I'm wondering if the buprenorphine is causing problems? It's a higher dose than I've taken in the past. I'm actually taking less than 16mg these days bc I'm tapering down but I was at that dose for a long time.

&amp;#x200B;

When it comes to adderall/ritalin, it's not like the medication doesn't work *at all*. My heart rate is increased (I have an Apple watch that tracks it), especially later in the day. But I don't get any improvement in focus, motivation, energy, etc. It's so bizarre. I also noticed the effectiveness of the medication decrease over time, especially noticing that it would be later in the day before it was effective at all.

&amp;#x200B;

Could there be some kind of imbalance that would affect all medications that affect my brain? If so, what could it be and what can I do about it?

&amp;#x200B;

I don't care about the phenibut or tianeptine not working. It's just an example of other compounds that have no affect even though I don't have a tolerance to them. I'm just scared something is really wrong with my brain and I *have* to get out of this funk where I have zero enthusiasm.

1296,"My thinking in this area is that if the chlorine at the fifth position on the phenyl ring were to be replaced by a hydrogen and the three extra carbons attached to the NH group eliminated and replaced by hydrogens, it would be methcathinone (ephedrone). Or if the oxygen at the ß position were replaced by a hydrogen, it would be methamphetamine. Then all that would be required to synthesize amphetamine is replace the methyl group attached to the NH group with a hydrogen. I know that’s a pretty long winded way to go to get to amphetamine, but I feel it could be viable if one were to have a large excess of bupropion and not be able to acquire the proper precursors for amphetamine. At the moment, I have no idea how one could achieve this. I have researched quite a bit and I’ve come up with nothing relating to the elimination of the groups and atoms I have described here.

My first ceremony is coming up in a couple of weeks and I’m excited to finally meet Mother Aya.

I had a friend introduced me to a retreat center and they’ve accepted me for two ceremonies in a couple weeks. He and another will be joining me on their own journeys as well. 
I’m going into this with a dependency on cannabis for almost a decade, anger issues stemming from an unknown source, and social anxiety which I’ve struggled with most of my life. Nightmares also plague my sleep, so getting proper rest is still a struggle.  

I feel ayahuasca will help me with these and perhaps even other things I am unaware of.  
I’m 28 and been through a fair amount of pain. From a failed marriage with an abusive spouse to bullying in school when I was younger.  

This won’t be my first psychedelic experience.  I’ve taken mushrooms a handful of times in the past.  Had mostly good experiences on them and come out of the experience much more open and lifted.  

As far as prep.  I’ve discontinued my cannabis use and going for at least 21 days free of it.  I’m seeing my counselor every other week to stem any frustrations I have in my life as well as discuss my before and after this ceremony.  
Also changing my diet to start moving toward the dieta they suggest for the ceremony.  I plan to be on that dieta solid week before and after.  

My friend told me that I should have something to occupy myself in between ceremonies.   I thought drawing would be neat. Seeing as there will be many things I may want to revisualize. 
Would you suggest anything else to do in between a ceremony?  We will be up in the mountains. 
I also thought of taking some music I enjoy. Seeing how it affects me. 
What do you think? 

I know I will probably experience the “Ego Death”. Which both frightens me and intrigued me. I know you’re supposed to give in and let it happen.  Any other tips on that? 

Finally, any suggestions to get the most out of a two day ceremony?  I may do it again in the future. However, for now I can only afford a two day weekend retreat.  

Thanks for reading and any advice you can offer.

HOWEVER...as where I have had previous experience with psychedelics (mushrooms, lsd, dmt)... he has no experience what-so-ever.

I know he is serious about the self work and wants to receive deep healing, and luckily we will be assisted by a great team of people, but obviously he is about to go on a really wild ride with no precursors and im nervous about his potential reaction to it.  As where I know it will be a great teacher for both of us, I also don't want this to traumatize him.

We have watched a couple of documentaries and he has done some reading up on it, but I know that nothing will really prepare him for it.  Even with my previous work with psychedelics, Im aware this wont compare with any experience I've previously had.

 Has anyone worked with Ayahuasca as their first psychedelic experience?  Is there anything I can do to better prepare him for this? I know ultimately its his own experience, but as my partner, I cant help but reach out to the community for advice if theres anything out there that would be beneficial.

1322,"While I am on the toilet for the third time now, I feel it is time to write here;

So in a nutshell, I brewed a batch yesterday with 50 grams MHRB, 15 grams of rue and some vinegar... 3 pulls.

I have been dieting for 15 days; only rice, beans, chickpeas, lentils, oatmeal, water and chamomile tea.

Today I had a small amount of whole grain rice and lentils for breakfast. And I ate a small amount of oatmeal 4 hours before drinking the brew (80 ml of 400 ml that I made yesterday). Also I took a nap after eating the oats.

Now it is two hours after ingesting the anahuasca. I had three trips to the toilet and except for that, and the effect of the rue I feel, nothing is happening. Then again while writing this I have faint CEV... I took another 40 ml half an hour ago. It doesn't taste as horrible as I have read, very very bitter and mildly gagging... But all in all okay.

I am starting to think that the root bark is not that good. It's from the Spanish vendor... I am also trying to pull some spice, but I am having a hard time to get results. But I am not giving up on the extraction. Either the bark is of low quality or I am also very tolerant to dmt, like I am to psilocybin and lsd...

1336,"To preface: I am 30 years old and went back to school to complete my BS in Biology last fall. I work full time, and about 4 months ago I decided I wanted some chemical enhancement. I was on Concerta when I was a teenager, so I booked a psych appointment and was honest that my ADD is mild at best but stimulants help me and I want them. Doctor was a bit disinterested/skeptical but I clearly knew my pharmacology and thus left with a scrip for 30mg Vyvanse.

Two months later we upped it to 40mg and things were okay for a month again, but the effects wear off within about 3 hours now. Obviously tolerance is forming despite my breaks on the weekends, so I requested an IR booster for the afternoons. The PA was cool with it but went to ask the doc and you would have thought I asked to switch to meth or something. Dude comes in to the office, asks me to get on the scale, says I'm losing weight (I've literally lost about 5 pounds, I'm 6'4"" 210lbs, low BF%) and ultimately tells me ""This office does NOT prescribe IR Adderall"". He tells me he wants to switch me to a drug called Mydayis and writes me a scrip for that. Claims it will serve the same purpose. I reluctantly agree to try it.

Mydayis is a new-ish amphetamine formulation. It's 3:1 dextro to levo just like Adderall, but it is *delayed* release instead of extended release. It is essentially designed to work like three IR pills within one pill, the first dose at T+0, the second T+4 hours or so, the third T+7-8 hours. It's also about $20 a pill and my insurance said ""fuck you, no one takes that"". I also could not find it at any pharmacies in town. I called the doc back and said ""Nowhere has this and insurance won't cover it, just give me the Vyvanse refill until I can figure out what I want to do."" He does so.

So at next appointment I came prepared with even more research and what I thought was a good point. I tell the PA ""Honestly I understand policy, but if the doctor says he won't prescribe me an IR booster and yet wants to prescribe me Mydayis, to me that says he doesn't trust me not to abuse the medication."" She expresses slight disagreement but I follow with ""Mydayis is *delayed* release, meaning it serves the same function as three IR pills. That means he agrees with the concept of a booster but will not prescribe one by policy. He is essentially saying 'I want to put you on IR Adderall but I don't trust you to dose it properly.'"" She resigns to this truth and apologizes.

I say essentially ""Look, I'm not trying to appear drug-seeking or denigrate your medical expertise, but there are plenty of people who take Vyvanse with some sort of IR amphetamine booster later in the day at doses FAR higher than I am on. If this office won't treat me in keeping with the current medical consensus as to what's safe then I will just take my final 40mg Vyvanse scrip today and find a new doctor."" She is a reasonable lady, apologizes again for the policy and says ""Let me see what I can do."" 

*It is important to note at this point that I have not requested an  Adderall booster by name a single time. The doctor was the one who made a big deal about Adderall. In fact, I really wanted Dexedrine since I prefer dextroamphetamine and Vyvanse is pure dextro as well.*
 
So the PA comes back in with the doctor. He's like ""Okay look, we don't prescribe IR Adderall and I am not breaking that policy for you. If you want to find another doctor I understand, but the best I can offer you as far as a booster is either of these two drugs (slides me a pamphlet for Evekeo and Zenzedi). These are the only boosters we offer.""

I literally smirk and then cannot stop myself from laughing in their faces. I think they thought I was mad, and while I was a little annoyed, it was not for the reason they thought. I can't resist and say ""No offense, but do you know what the formulations of these are?""

Doctor says ""Yes, they are immediate release amphetamine. The Evekeo has two kinds and the Zenzedi is just dextroamphetamine."" 

I'm like ""Yeah, I know. I'll take the Zenzedi, I actually can't believe I had to threaten to find a new doctor for you to offer this to me.""

PA is staring at the floor and doc is looking confused but starts to write the scrip. I say ""I just want to be clear - we all know that Adderall is 75% dextroamphetamine and 25% levoamphetamine, right?"" They all nod like *what's your point?*

""So if you're prescribing me 100% dextro with no issue, and you offered me a racemic mix without issue, the policy against Adderall actually has nothing whatsoever to do with the contents of the pill and everything to do with the name 'Adderall"", right?""

PA smirks but does not respond, doctor says ""We simply do not prescribe that formulation. By Policy."" I laugh, take the scrip, say thank you, I wanted dexedrine the whole time anyway.

I just thought this was a rather hilarious example of how even medical professionals who know better can fall victim to stigmas surrounding certain drugs and try to distance themselves from them. It's a bit sad, but also a bit understandable I guess. 

Either way, I got my dexedrine so now I'm crushing work and writing 1k word reddit posts in ten minutes for fun so it's ultimately fine, just saying.

Hello I will be volunteering in January at an Ayahuasca healing centre. I am looking for any advice and tips one might have about this role. *** EDIT: at most my role would be helping people to the bathroom and emptying purge buckets, sorry should have clarified that earlier ***

Some background info: I am a 28 year old female who is passionate about the therapeutic &amp; healing benefits of psychedelics, reading many articles and books on the subject and giving it much personal thought. I have experience with LSD, shrooms, DMT , MDMA all of which led to massive realizations and shifts in my understanding of the world and the human experience, thus opening my heart and my mind. I have a degree in anthropology, and will be a certified massage practitioner by the time I leave. I am a good listener and able to put my whole self into hearing and supporting another. I am body positive I am unassuming, as they say. I try to say less and listen more, although of course I put my foot in my mouth a lot. I am not aloof but I dislike small talk about work, pop culture etc... I find it exhausting and categorizing. I believe that everyone shares common ground in some aspect of their human experience, so I enjoy exploring these bridges, talking about and hearing about others experiences etc. 

I will be accompanying my sister as she participates in a 12 day retreat. Hopefully I will be able to be a helper during her ceremonies. It will be so hard but I think healing for both of us. She has suffered from addiction for about 15 years. She has been sober now for almost 3 years, with relapse. She is a chronic full-time weed smoker, and also she does cocaine sometimes with her partner. They barely leave the house. They sleep all day and watch movies, shows, cat videos. They live in the bed it's very hard to see. She becomes very irritable, erratic, and reactive when she is feeling vulnerable. She has never travelled like this before. Apparently she has tried LSD and Shrooms but felt nothing. She wants to have a mystical experience. We are super close after all these challenging years. I have learned so much from her and the challenges we have gone through together. There is a lot of pain in her heart from years of addiction and physical abuse that she has not really dealt with. Conventional Western therapies do not work for her. She is tired of talking about it all, it's nothing for her to casually relate to me a truly terrifying memory, but I feel the trauma is lodged in her body &amp; soul. She has an extreme amount of energy but she nullifies it by sleeping all day, chain smoking, caffeine sugar weed addiction, after all this she feels tired, of course this leads to insufferable periods of restlessness. It is no use to lecture her about experimenting with a healthier lifestyle and selfcare, she knows all this intellectually. We have a special relationship, I can usually understand whats going on for her during her struggles. I can usually get through to her, I usually know when to push and when to pull back. I say 'usually' because of course I make mistakes and become frustrated. We are able to be vulnerable with each other.

 If you have any advice after reading all this about being a supportive helper during an Ayahuasca retreat please let me know...

1347,"First off, ibogaine is dangerous. Flood doses can be deadly. The risks to users are far greater than dmt. Ive had a full physical and EKG before ever exploring. The fine folks at r/ibogaine were very helpful. 

Second off, i never ingest dmt/ibogaine/whatever, unless I'm in my safe place. To me this looks like, at home, with my RN wife watching over me, the woman who has kept me safe when I can not, for over 10yrs. She is my shaman. For others this looks like a retreat or even a more medicinal setting. Either way, these medicines require a safe place. 

I've taken anywhere from 100mg to 500mg ibogaine TA on several occasions over the last few months. Twice a month on average. I find currently the sweet spot to be about 250mg. Its a wonderful complement to my many oral dmt plus MAOI journeys in the same time frame. I find it's best to have 48hrs fairly free from responsibilities. For me it goes like....

First couple to few hours slight nasuea, usually minimal movement. Somewhat pleasent somewhat anxious time of dreamy meditation. Perhaps scenes from my distant past float to the surface for viewing. Emotions as well. With the lower doses none of this is particularly overwhelming but once the door is open you can always dial in. Even if it's only open a crack. And dial in I do. Hrs 5 through 24 are typically introspective with much greater sense of self awareness than is my baseline at that present. If you've developed the practice of watching thoughts, on or off cushion, it may help magnify that process 10 fold. For a time anyway. All quite extraordinary,  breathtaking,  and heartbreakingly beautiful. To see many layers deeper into yourself than normal but, also to be faced with the realization that the clarity will receed. Oh what a ride. Day 2 and even 3 are still very noticeable. Upbeat mood that comes from looking at yourself bravely. Also, much more connected to the flow. Much more. Everything moves along just fine. Much love to everyone here. I enjoy sharing my journey. Thank you for reading.

I’m am going to an ayahuasca retreat in December and am looking for advice.

I have depression and have tried multiple traditional medications like anti depressants, counselling and meditation to help out of those three the meditation helped the most. Someone has put me on to ayahuasca and I know that you’ve to go with specific questions in mind.

During each ceremony should I focus on one question or ask the multiple questions that I have in mind.

At a guess, I would assume that by having one in mind for each ceremony, I have 4 in total, that would stopped me being overwhelmed by my experience but I do have more than 4 questions to ask.

I have never tried any psychedelic before, including Ayahuasca, and was wondering what the community thought regarding it for a first experience in this type of headspace? I am moving to a new country, where I believe there are some Ayahuasca retreat centers, and I was considering going to one. However, I may have the opportunity to try mushrooms with a friend soon, and wanted to know if doing a moderate dose of those first could possibly make the Ayahuasca experience easier to integrate? I am thinking this because it seems to me that Ayahuasca is generally more powerful than shrooms, and I will probably only be taking somewhere around 2.5 grams. However, the plus-side of the Ayahuasca retreat is that it will be guided, in a close community with professional healers. With the mushroom experience, it will just be me and my friend, sitting in his home. I guess what I'm getting at is, I don't want to bite off more than I can chew. I want to approach these substances with a healthy amount of fear and respect, and I want to do what I can to limit my risk of PTSD or psychosis from a bad trip. From my limited knowledge, it seems that jumping into an Ayahuasca trip with little experience in this type of headspace is like jumping into the deep end of the pool.

First of all, we would like to thank all of you who have participated and/or contributed in any other way, such as spreading our advertisement. 

Secondly, although many have already responded to our call, we want to inform (or maybe even remind) you that you can help us by completing our survey(s).

Watch this promo video about our surveys and then **please do come back and read on**…

[https://vimeo.com/265532309](https://vimeo.com/265532309)

With these surveys, the Imperial team hopes to advance our understanding of the effects of psychedelics, and so help maximise safety, awareness, and wellness.

All surveys are anonymous, reaching out to people who intend to take a psychedelic drug in the near future, but each has a different focus. Three of them are:

**1.** **Global Psychedelic Survey:** Are you planning a psychedelic experience using a classical psychedelic (e.g. LSD, ayahuasca, psilocybin) or related drug (e.g. Iboga/Ibogaine, salvia or Ketamine) in any kind of setting **apart from an organised retreat or ceremony**? Then Imperial’s Global Psychedelic Survey is your survey! For more information and to sign up, visit [https://global.psychedelicsurvey.com](https://global.psychedelicsurvey.com/). 

**2. Microdosing Survey:** Are you planning to begin a course of microdosing soon, i.e. taking very small amounts of a psychedelic over a given period of time, e.g. 4 weeks? Then check out Imperial’s microdosing survey [https://microdosingsurvey.com](https://nam02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%253A%252F%252Fmicrodosingsurvey.com&amp;data=02%257C01%257C%257Cb6aa6b9ba2254a2c04ce08d5a5c7c79d%257C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%257C1%257C0%257C636597199821400957&amp;sdata=ZcDf6Cn9vQVrCgbWSbzM7U5H1l9N6YHOok2Av2RMUBw%253D&amp;reserved=0).

**3. Ceremony Survey:** Are you planning on participating in an organised psychedelic ceremony or psychedelic drug retreat sometime soon? If so, please consider signing up for the Psychedelic Ceremony Study, which will collect data on the psychological effects of psychedelic use in these unique settings. For more information and to sign up, visit [https://ceremonystudy.com](https://ceremonystudy.com/). Also see this video, which explains how ceremony survey works [https://vimeo.com/265532154](https://vimeo.com/265532154).

It might well be the case that another survey will be added in the meantime, so make sure to visit [https://www.psychedelicsurvey.com/](https://www.psychedelicsurvey.com/). There, you can see to which survey studies you can currently contribute, and you can also sign up for the newsletter to remain updated.

1364,"Hello everyone,

I want to share my experience with Ayahuasca to give a fuller picture of what the ceremonies may entail. When I was researching Aya I didn't find many resources sharing this perspective and I feel it should also be shared, along with the positive experiences. This is only my subjective expereince, I'm not invalidating or questioning other experiences.

About 4 months ago I did two ceremonies which completely blew me away. The first was emotionally very difficult, I was broken down and faced with my deepest fear but I came out of it stronger. The second was incredibly beautiful and I connected with God/the universe/mother nature in a profound way. For days following I was unable to sleep but was receiving 'downloads' of what I thought were truths or revelations and had to write them down durign the night. My eating disorder disappeared, I had a strong sense of knowing what I needed to do and how, no more confusion, no more anxiety, no anger. I walked around really seeing people and their 'hearts', people responded to me in very different ways and I suddenly had a lot of creative inspiration and started writing songs and painting.

This lasted for a few weeks and it was amazing. I felt very connected to myself, others and nature. However, after about a month, I started having nightmares, which I had never experienced before in my life. I would wake up in the middle of the night and be terrified. I felt like there was an evil presence in my room watching me. One night I told 'it' to leave and I felt an uncomfortable, terrifying heat like energy go down my spine. For a few nights I laid in bed, terrified, with the lights on. I was told I needed to go see a healer (who does energy work) and go to Kundalini yoga workshops, but they didn't help. One night I started praying to Jesus (my grandmother had told me to do this in case I was afraid when I was young) and the fear subsided and I was able to sleep that night. The sleep problems continued though and one night I didn't sleep at all until morning. I told my mother about it and she recommended I call a man who has a ministry in 'deliverance', which in some Christian circles refers to commanding evil spirits to leave. I wasn't so sure but I was desperate so I called him. He said he had seen this happen with someone else after an ayahuasca ceremony and that I may have invited something into my life and he simply prayed for me over the phone. That same night and since then (so  about three months ago) I have not had any nightmares and been able to sleep through the night.

I'm quite confused about what actually took place. Of course, one may question the causal relation between ayahuasca and the nightmares, and then the prayer and their cessation. This is my subjective interpratation but in my mind there is no doubt about it. I feel that these ceremonies may open people up to realms or forces we may not understand or control. Traditionally, Ayahuasca is done with an experienced shaman (who usually descends from a long line of shamans) and people stay within these communities, near their shamans, who can perhaps protect them from these things. I think it can be dangerous to experiment with these things and then go off into your previous context. In the short run it usually seems to help, but in the long term it may open new, maybe greater issues. And if you're not prepared to handle that in some way or have people around you that know how, I think it can be very risky and ultimately bring more harm than good. I'm not maligning anyone involved with Ayahuasca, in my experience they are all very well-intentioned people, authentically seeking to help others heal and grow. But these things may be beyond our control and understanding. Maybe we should be a bit more careful with these things!

1366,"Two weeks ago I attended a “three day” retreat at Soul Quest Ayahuasca Church of the Mother Earth. With the heaviest heart I must report what I saw and experienced. 
They advertise that they offer psychotherapy before and after each ceremony. This, from what I experienced, was far from true. Their psychotherapy is nothing more than a round circle of god knows, 30 or so people who are limited to a few minutes to discuss their experience. There is a short breath work workshop before the ceremony. 
The facility is ok, but there is no privacy, not even in the bathroom. They offer two showers and two toilet stalls outside. No doors just shower curtains. I was walked in on twice. They do have a bathroom inside but good luck with that.
Their meals do not follow the Ayahuasca diet. Their staff is loud and seem to be partying. I didn’t drink the second night because I was so uncomfortable with what I saw and knew this place was nothing more than a money maker.
The founder, Chris, is absent. He is on the phone, in his kitchen, not available for talk at all. I don’t know much about this Doctor they have on staff. Can’t find anything about him outside of his own amateur  website. He also was very disconnected and doing things that he should have put aside to concentrate on the attendees. When I spoke with him I could tell he was not listening, just nodding and smiling. When I revisited the conversation that we two had had he could not recall a single thing we had spoke about. It was very frustrating.
The advertise hepe workshop. But a workshop is far from what is delivered. Mostly it’s just the staff sitting around doing hepe together. I’m telling you, these people are so distracted from what they should be doing. I see a lot of problems coming from this place in the future.
I have emailed and called several times to discuss my concerns and have not received a single reply. Very unprofessional, they were more than willing to communicate before I paid them.

I mention this one because it was made as a safer alternative to MDMA, according to wikipedia. Many years ago I found an RC website selling it. It wasn't some site that had listings for every RC imaginable or something, it was a basic NBOMe seller that got other stuff on occasion. He could have sold bk-MDMA even easier than this but instead listed this as the product he had. I mention this because many people find it hard to believe any RC vendor would have this type of chemical. So I tried it and it was pretty awesome. Basically MDMA-lite and the non-existent comedown/suicide Tuesday confirmed this.

I'm not advocating for this chem specifically (although its reason for being synth'd is quite relevant) but more just wondering why ""safer"" empathogens like this aren't being studied for treatments like MDMA.

1372,"Hey all! 

Returned from a 5 day retreat earlier this month at New Life Ayahuasca in Costa Rica. 
Amazing place. I want to give you all a full breakdown of what the trip is like. I am not going to go to deep into how my experience with the medicine was, as that is very subjective, but more into the itinerary of the trip and how the place is in general. 

SO! 

Basically you fly into San Jose Costa Rica and a nice shuttle picks you up from the airport to take you to the retreat. You meet other members of the retreat at the airport pick up location and head off! 
My girlfriend and I met a small group of people whom were all really amazing and nice and linked up with the driver. 
The retreat is about 45 mins to an hour outside of San Jose. It is near a city called San Ramon if you want to google it. 

You arrive at this BEAUTIFUL compound basically. Its a very large house with lots of rooms. You have your own room with bathroom. Very comfortable. There is a large lap pool and hot tub. There are lounging areas. Sweeping views of the valley and ocean, a fire pit, kitchen, etc. 

Matt and Jeanae run the place and are some of the kindest people we have met! They stay on the property and are there for you the whole time. 
The meals are provided and are delicious. Common meals are eggs, fresh fruit, chicken and rice soup, veggies, grilled chicken, greens, plantains etc. The food is amazing and delicious. Keep in mind you are following a loose Ayahuasca dieta which restricts spices, red meats, coffee, etc. There is herbal tea available for you and their water source comes from a well which is filtered so the water is very pure and no one got sick from the food or water on our trip and I highly doubt anyone ever has. Very clean facilities. 

The first day you just kind of chill. The ceremonies are on the 2nd and 4th night. 

The ceremony day you cut off food after lunch and stop water a few hours before the ceremony. The ceremony starts when it gets dark and you go into the ceremony room, which is beautiful, and get settled. 

The medicine is strong and Matt and Jeanae do an excellent job of guiding the ceremony. You have multiple opportunities to get up and drink more medicine, so don't worry about not being able to go deep. 

I benefited tons from the first ceremony. 

On the third day we went to a nearby waterfall which was beautiful. Most of the days I spent reading, swimming, walking on the nearby trails, or dare I say working on my computer (there is full wi-fi and it was a crazy work week) 

The second ceremony went very well. It is hard work dont get me wrong, but I am sure you can do reading on the actual Ayahuasca experience, I want this to be more of a post about how this retreat works. 

The third day there is also an optional Kambo medicine ceremony. I opted out but my girlfriend did it. She said it was intense but has felt benefits in the following weeks. 

The fifth day you wake up have breakfast and chill and hit the road. 

Overall I cannot recommend this place enough. The facilities are amazing, the trip was smooth, the hosts are great, and you feel taken care of. 

Costa Rica is a very safe country. 

This is not a 5 star resort but a very nice place where you can explore your truth and get some work done. 

I highly suggest taking a few days after to go to a beach or explore Costa Rica further. 

Any questions feel free to ask. To look up their retreat just google New Life Ayahuasca

The powder is created by crushing/grinding coca leaves, not extracting them in any manner, and thus it's not really comparable to actual cocaine. Say I was hypothetically interested in acquiring such a powder and ingesting it in low to moderate doses - how safe would that be?

Basically, this is a question about how cardiotoxic consuming moderate amounts of coca leaves is. I have read the coca leaf is widely consumed in south america, quite frequently in many cases by the locals, and I have not come across any reports of adverse effects. The leaves do of course contain small amounts of cocaine tho, which makes me concerned about potential cardiotoxicity since coke is one of the most cardiotoxic stims out there by far.

I searched around but couldn't really find any information on how cardiotoxic coca leaf is, if at all. Most people just seem to be saying ""it's a plant so it's fine"" (an appeal to nature fallacy) or ""it's been used for hundreds of years so it's fine"" (which is more convincing given the lack of reports about bad effects but still potentially an appeal to tradition fallacy).

The one post I could find that seemed helpful is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DrugNerds/comments/2ntwmp/cocaine_cardiotoxicitycoca_cardiotoxicity/cmgx5p0/). The user fisolani in the comment thread I linked seems quite convinced that coca leaf is completely harmless, but I'm not sure where he got that idea so he might not be trustworthy.

I just wanted to know if Ayahuasca might be able to help me.

I have been severely bullied when I was a child and a teenager. I was the perfect victim because I just froze when it happened and never defended myself and I just let it happen. I am a very sensitive person and I may have Aspergers, but the jury is still out on that.

Every day I have flashbacks about what happened combined with anger and the feeling of powerlessness.

I have done everything in my power. I tried medicine like SSRI and I did psychotehreapy, but it did not help.

1398,"So, I am very interested in growing my own ayahuasca. However there are 2 problems I see in that:
1) Majority of the plants needed to make ayahuasca are HUGELY tall trees... in my opinion, much too tall to harvest from on a regular basis.
2) Majority of the plants needed also take a very long time to grow... 

My goal is to grow ayahuasca, but eliminate the 2 problems above. I thought of the idea of stunting the tree's growth using small pots, and growing these ""mini"" trees that are hopefully short enough to be harvested from regularly, and yet that also could possibly make them not take forever to grow... 

Has anyone had experience in growing ayahuasca plants in small pots, trying to stunt the height of their growth and thus decrease the time required until harvest as well? 

It's a big concern of mine, as I'd LOVE to be able to grow ayahuasca, but I don't think it's possible unless something like this is possible... Anyone that can tell me about their experience with this or general advice with this would be much appreciated. ",Ayahuasca,Growing ayahuasca

1406,"Greetings!

This past year I did my first Ayahuasca &amp; Huachuma (San Pedro) retreat in Ecuador. This was such a game changer for me in so many ways, especially for my mental health, spirituality, and creativity.

My plan is to return to the same place I went to this summer.

I have a very close friend who wants to come with, but he is 2 years sober and activity involved in AA. He’s nervous because he gets a mixed response from people in his program. His sponsor says he’d break his sobriety.

More importantly he’s worried about the feeling of being “F*****d Up” and that it might trigger a relapse, especially if he doesn’t have a positive/enlightening experience.

Now I know that Ayahuasca is not all love and light. I know there’s a dark side, and that these medicines, in the wrong hands can cause harm.

I personally was terrified leading up to each ceremony but when the glass was handed to me I was able to “surrender” and just ask the medicine to keep me safe, which it did. I “trusted” Mother Ayahuasca and the Curadera leading ceremony and I felt protected. But I don’t know if thats good advice to give to someone else?  

I also know that I’ve “heard” that Ayahuasca can actually help with addictive behaviors, but not entirely sure.

So my question is, are there any of you in who’ve drank Ayahuasca post-recovery? If so, how has it impacted your sobriety? And has anyone ever heard of Ayahuasca triggering a relapse?

If I sliced up a typical day here, it would be something like this in a pie chart: 40% cannabis related content/posts, 30% psilocybin/psychedelic posts, 15% posts regarding anecdotal accounts of how some drug “cured” a physical or psychological affliction they had, and 15% posts that seem more appropriate for this sub Reddit. 

Yeah those numbers are exaggerated but I always notice something. Studies that show positive results of illicit drugs commonly used for recreational, non-medical purposes gets tons of discussion (mostly about anecdotal accounts or how the study “proves” that the drug is amazing, or people asking what any of the scientific terminology means) and upvotes. For example, the MDMA assisted psychotherapy study had over 40 upvotes (the older one not the current one). Meanwhile, a post I made linking to an article on the role of the TAAR1 receptor in certain types of monoamine drugs got far fewer. 

I’m not disgruntled over that, but it kind of pisses me off that people come here to support a narrative of “oh yeah, MDMA should be legal because I feel less depressed when I roll three times a week”. I just want to see more actual discussion on neurology, pharmacology, abs drug chemistry.

1432,"The way we diagnose PTSD seems to be arbitrary in some sense. Not that the symptoms are arbitrary, these are likely observations of aversion learning in general or when it surpasses a certain degree of intensity. It seems to be the case that addiction is the extreme form of pleasure learning, mediated by endogenous opioids, while PTSD is the extreme form of aversion learning. The mechanisms are almost opposite, where NMDAr are boosted by pleasure opioids and NMDAr are inhibited by aversion opioids. The body’s aversion opioid is dynorphin. 

I think we culturally normalize a lot of things that may be considered trauma in the distant future as our ethics and quality of life improve in society. The degree of intensity that we label as PTSD symptoms are just those that surpass the culturally normalized trauma responses. 

And I think psychedelics undo our coping behaviors centered around these normalized traumas, in some sense treating PTSD and addiction, but also exposing us again to the raw information that was habitually neglected in order to maintain a stable sense of wellbeing.

Ayahuasca taught me this. I can't explain what I've seen on an Ayahuasca experience but it taught me how to feel. Ayahuasca taught me things I've never seen in my physical life. By physical, I mean since day 1 I've set forth on this earth. But! Ayahuasca taught me something outside the box I call 'earth', and that is: the reality of human being. Everything outside the box calle dearth cannot be learned mechanically, but rather experienced through psychedelics.

I am very thankful for my sense of grounding with spirit because despite my loss of senses and perception from entheogens, cannabis and mind bending drugs, I still find the core. The core, the center, the spirit. I don't know what to call it. There is no right term in the physical world (the learned world) because it don't exist... yet war of consciousness is real, and I think the Illuminati knows this. I think the Illuminati exists, they are a group of people who believe there is more to it than the physical world or as I would say the 'learned world'. The learned world is our society today.

Ayahuasca taught me this. It has exactly been a year and a month since my encounter with psychedelics and I have never been so thankful. Without it, my life would have been so much more stagnant. Living the mechanical, fake world of learnedness. Psychedelics taught me how to think outside the box. It taught me rationality. it taught me peace. It taught me how to become one with myself: the material and the spiritual. It taught me how to be.

1450,"I was born a Hindu. All my life I was searching for a tangible proof of God. Since I didn’t find it, I became an atheist. I didn’t want to accept mere empty words of any religions as proof of God. I strongly believe in science and in the basic tenets of science, like verifiability, reproducibility etc. The scientific principles are objective truth and there is no subjective interpretation. What I mean is, if someone says that they’ve experienced God, I will not accept it at face value. I was such a strong believer in atheism that I detested religious people for their gullibility, naïveté etc. 

I have everything that life has to offer. Good job, nice house, wife &amp; kids. I travel a lot. There was this nagging questions about meaning &amp; purpose of life, reason for mindless suffering in this world, understanding infinity, creation etc. that I couldn’t put to rest. I didn’t want to accept the messages of any religions. I admired the believers for blindly accepting what their religion offered and life on with their lives.  I was feeling like the hosts in the HBO series “West world”. There was an existential angst that made living hard. 

I came across a Ted talk about Ayahuasca. It mentioned people experiencing spirit world &amp; god and got curious. I read everything about psychedelics/DMT. I went to Iquitos, Peru to try Ayahuasca. In a blink of an eye, I became a believer of God. Here is a short summary:

1) I became one with God under the full effects of Ayahuasca. You cannot see God, as God is the seer. You become God. This is the Hindu’s advaita principle. This is the goal of enlightenment, ie to realize that we are God.

2) I felt myself as a vibrational force that is part of every atom in every single object/living matter. When you think about it, all matters are made of atoms, atoms are made of sub atomic particles. All the particles are nothing but energy vibrating. In essence, every thing is a vibration.

3) There was no concept of past, present or future. It was all merged into one. There was no concept of time. It was like a fluid state.

4) I felt that I was everywhere, like occupying the entire infinity. There was no beginning or end in both concepts of time &amp; space.

5) I had the revelation that I was born many times in this world.

6) I had the revelation that everything is an illusion in this life, including all pain and suffering. The more pain and suffering you experience, the closer you are to God. (I’m still grappling with this concept. But this is what I experienced). The pain &amp; suffering helps you think about God all the time and you get closer to God.

7) You need to keep objects/things that remind you of God in your day to day life.

8) All religions are the same and help people realize God. The religions may follow different customs, traditions, etc but the end goal is the same. 

The being of oneness with God felt 1000 times more real than the life that I’m experiencing today. Without the Ayahuasca experience, If I had read this same post from someone else, I would have said “You are delusional &amp; stupid. I wont accept a word of what you are saying. There is absolutely no proof in anything that you’ve said”.

I’m reading what I can get to make sense of what I’ve experienced.

I mention UCLA because at least to my knowledge, UCLA is supposed to be one of the top providers of quality psychiatric care. But all of these things haven't really helped me. I don't know if they've helped me at all, honestly. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know that most of you are probably not trained psychiatrists/therapists, but I need guidance from people with experience with ayahuasca.

&amp;#x200B;

I should preface with why I want to try ayahuasca. To say this year has been utter hell would be an understatement. It all started a year ago around August 2017. I was experimenting with lsd and, initially, things were going great. I had some really good times tripping with my friends and I loved the psychedelic experience. But it all went wrong so fast. I guess its important to mention that I had already been struggling with fairly moderate depression for several years. Not severe at that point, but not mild either. However, things back then were much better than they are now. At least in most respects. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 20 years old right now. My depression up until last year was mainly based on severe guilt and shame. I felt like I did some terrible things in my past, and I couldn't forgive myself. My thoughts would constantly revolve around how unworthy and shitty of a person I was for what I did. I tried it the way society wants you to. I sought help from psychiatrists, I attend therapy a multitude of times, and I took my meds as prescribed. But I still felt like something was missing inside. I still hated myself. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So, summer of 2017 comes around, and my friends are all back from their first year of college. My good friend tells me about his experiences on LSD and I become interested in trying it. Me and a couple of close friends each take a tab, and my first trip ends up being amazing. Music sounds even more incredible, my thinking is clear, and I experience ideas and deep thoughts that I haven't for some time. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

That summer I probably took LSD around 8 times. Things were mostly fine until one fateful day when I visited my friend in Santa Barbara. We each took around 2 tabs of LSD, and had a great time. When we got back to my friends house, my friend tells me that he just got some DMT and offered me some to try. I knew a little about DMT, but I wasn't prepared for how intense the experience was. So I was coming down on LSD, and I first decide to smoke some weed with friends. The weed makes me feel terrible. I had smoked weed many times before, but this time I felt super anxious and paranoid. I guess I thought it was just one of those ""bad trips"" people sometimes get on weed. I had them before, so I wasn't super worried that it would last or anything. 

&amp;#x200B;

So just to clarify, at this point I still haven't smoked the DMT yet. So far I've spent the day tripping on LSD, which went well, and then I smoked some weed on the LSD comedown and became very anxious and paranoid. Well, for some reason, when my friend offered the DMT, I still decided to smoke it. I inhale the vaporized DMT, and instantly feel it. I'm sitting in my friends dorm and I'm definitely experiencing DMT's effects. Those 5 minutes weren't terrifying, and I barely inhaled that much, but I definitely felt very uncomfortable. I didn't feel relaxed at all and I just wanted the trip to end. I knew it was only 5 minutes, so I didn't panic, but looking back, I was worried I would be stuck in that state. 

&amp;#x200B;

Oddly enough, I don't think I really experienced any thoughts besides the feeling of anxiety throughout the trip. I saw interesting shapes and patterns, but besides that, I don't remember anything that significant. After about 5 minutes, the DMT started to slowly get out of my system. Once I came down fully, I still felt crappy. And not just crappy, but I felt very off. My anxiety was through the roof, I was having trouble talking to my friends, and I had this new, very strange headache/pressure. I drove home later that night and just thought the feeling would go away in the next few days. 

&amp;#x200B;

The feeling didn't disappear though. I don't know why, but I still decided to trip again on LSD a week later. I should probably mention I was overdoing the acid that summer. I was taking LSD like every week or so. I have no idea if that matters or not. I had taken acid 6 times before the DMT, and a week after the DMT, I took LSD because I was still feeling weird, and thought it would help me snap out of it. But instead it took how I was feeling and made it from bad to Utter torturous. 

&amp;#x200B;

That last LSD trip I thought I was going to lose my mind. I felt like I snapped my sanity. I couldn't think straight. My anxiety was constantly though the roof. My headaches were so bad I felt like my head would explode. I have never been the same since DMT and that last LSD trip. I can't think these days without my thoughts pausing, or my internal monologue sounding like its mumbling/stuttering. My mind is mostly always blank, and this feeling of agitation is always with me. Some people have suggested I just think out loud since I can't do it n my head, but for some reason I can't manage to do that. Every time I have a thought and it ""messes up"" (which is almost always) it creates this panic attack/dysphoric feeling that makes me want to slam my head against a wall until it finally works. 

&amp;#x200B;

I never had this problem before. I don't enjoy anything these days. I used to love to listen to music. I could listen to music and skateboard for hours on end. Now music sounds like gibberish to me. I'm sorry if this doesn't make a lot of sense. I can't describe my experience very well. My doctors have tried to help, but they are at a loss. They are almost certain that I am not going crazy, even though I have been very worried thats exactly whats happening. I heard that although its very rare, some people can develop schizophrenia after taking psychedelics. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, this all leads to some questions. I want to try ayahuasca because I think it might be my only chance of saving my life. I really tried guys, but I can't go on this way anymore. Im not just depressed, I feel like my brain is damaged. I was a smart kid, but these days I feel unintelligent. Sometimes I feel like my mind is gone. Like I am slowly marching to my death. 

Im not schizophrenic, but I've been worried I might become one. After all, I am 20 years old and I have this weird thought disorder thing going on already, and Ive taken a decent amount of psychedelic drugs. My psychiatrists assure me that they don't think that Im going insane, and last week, they told me that medication is probably not the answer. But talk therapy is getting me nowhere either: talking won't fix my thoughts and make them clear and fluid like they used to be. 

&amp;#x200B;

Do you guys think I should try ayahuasca? Do you think that I could go insane? If so what can I do to insure I have the most therapeutic outcome possible? I guess my mind is kind of set on trying it, but I have my reservations. I know this was a lot to read but any input is greatly appreciated and is truly invaluable to me. Thank you.

America’s drug war costs about $51 billion each year. Innocent people locked up. Police abuse.

It’s ugly. 

It’s a twisted view of conscious-altering substances.

This article is not about drugs like heroin or cocaine. Those are altered chemical substances that are harmful, toxic, you should stay away from those.

This article is about medicines. Plant medicines to be exact.

Plant medicines are not drugs. They are medicinal. They heal. On a level more profound than any pharmaceutical drug.

Plant medicines are conscious beings that commune with your mind, body and soul. The medicines have an intelligence beyond a human intelligence, indeed, beyond even a human understanding. 

These beings are small pods of Cosmic Consciousness wrapped up in a beautiful leafy tree or plant. How poetic of God to send us information in such precious capsules.

I’d like to tell you about how other cultures perceive these plant medicines. They weren’t locking people up or spending billions on SWAT teams. Their frame for understanding these plants was magical and beautiful.

My hope is one day our society will get back to that understanding.

--- Plant Medicines can be Food or Entheogens ---

Firstly, the term entheogen just means a substance that enhances consciousness, like a psychedelic.

A great quote by Hippocrates, founder of medicine from ancient Greece, says, “Let food be thy medicine”. That’s everything we need to know as a society for solving obesity, diabetes, cancer… everything! 

If we look at food as medicine, and we look at plants as the purest providers of healing, we start on the path of conscious evolution. 

A life where you consume only medicinal plants as food is a life of happiness, pure energy and joy, optimism, an ordered brain, and the high human potential of achieving and creating whatever you seek.

It’s what should be normal… but of course, we’ve lost our way. That’s okay, we’re coming back around.

Now let’s move up a level. Supposing you eat medicinal plant foods, and you reach that enlightened, energetic state as your default state of life, then what?

How can you go up one level beyond that, past the human potential and into the Cosmic? Into the type of consciousness that can experience the universe as an integral part of your identity? The type of consciousness that Jesus, Buddha, Shiva… all the great masters taught and lived by? 

The Earth is our mother and she provides. Along with food, her bounty of entheogenic plant medicines matches perfectly with the human physiology. 

Plant medicines that produce altered states of consciousness are like a rocket ship, taking you directly to the highest planes of existence, to greater dimensions of reality, where for a few hours you can taste the world that Jesus and Buddha lived in.

The Ayahuasca trend of today is modern society’s grasping for this lost spirituality – an experiential spirituality, as opposed to how it’s taught in Bible studies or Sunday schools where information is handed down from an authoritative figure. No, this spirituality is to be lived by you, to be experienced, to feel it and see it, as real as if you were experiencing eating rice. It isn’t a metaphor. It’s an actual experience. 

If you’ve never been to our retreats, that last paragraph might seem weird. But it’s just abstract – very abstract – it’s not a concept we run into in our day-to-day. 

Mother Earth knows this. She knows human life is hard. She knows we get lost in the weeds, trying to pay bills and fight traffic. So the biology of the Earth is such that humans (and animals!) have evolved to be able to consume and experience, chemically, physically, and mystically, the intelligence of certain plants as consciousness-expanding.

Just like we’ve evolved the ability to be able to eat fruits and vegetables for nutrition. It’s completely natural.

So let’s look at these plants not as drugs, because they’re not harmful but actually beneficial; let’s look at them as a type of technology, a certain intelligence that we are accepting and communing with to learn from.

--- Jesus healed with Cannabis Oil ---

“Jesus Healing the Blind” from 12th Century Basilica Catedrale di Santa Maria Nouva di Monreale in Sicily

This blew my mind when I first learned about it. But it makes total sense. Cannabis was popularly used throughout most of human history, even in America.

So Jesus was given the title “Christ” which means “the Anointed One”. Anointed, specifically, with cannabis oil. 

And he walked around and healed the sick using this same cannabis oil (mixed with other ingredients probably).

Cannabis oil is good for glaucoma and epilepsy. Jesus ‘healed the blind and cast out demons’. They probably meant glaucoma and epilepsy.

Again, don’t look at this as a drug – it’s not, it’s a healing plant. Look at it as a technology that Jesus understood and used to benefit his people.

The Vedics used Soma

The Vedic texts are the oldest scriptures of Hinduism. Incredible treasures of knowledge.

Those texts speak lovingly of Soma, the word they used for potions made from plants. We’re not sure what plants exactly but the point is the Vedics knew about these plants as consciousness-expanding helpers. 

Combining plant medicine with meditation, clean food and a pure lifestyle is the path to enlightenment. The ancients knew this and wrote books about it. 

--- Shamans use all types of Plant Medicines ---

Ayahuasca is trendy right now, but if you didn’t know, there are many entheogenic plant medicines like Ayahuasca. In our Ashram, the plant medicine we use is Jurema, much more loving and gentle than Ayahuasca. This is just one of many.

In the Amazon there is Yopo, Ambil, Mambe… (&lt;- our retreats use all of these as well) for each tribe in each different region, there was a local plant that had wisdom from other realms. Spiritual knowledge. The tribes usually had a dedicated shaman (or shamans) to cultivate and share these plants. They built ceremonies around this. They learned songs from these experiences and started creating rituals, crafting the building blocks of religion.

Shamans from Siberia cultivated mushrooms of magic. The mushrooms were red and white and the shamans would dress like the mushrooms and share them with their people. This is where the legend of Santa Clause came from. The reindeer were actually the shaman’s spirit animals. 

Jurema was originally an ancient medicine of the Aztecs and Mayans. It’s unfortunate that it became a lost tradition, even in Mexico today they don’t know about it, they mostly use the tree for skin products. But we’re working to restore the tradition of the plant medicine as an entheogen.

Ancient Egyptians had cannabis plants carved into their tombstones. A powerful plant that was used for making paper, as food, oil – incredible properties. 

All of these cultures understood that these were higher technologies from nature. All of those cultures were much more connected to the natural world than we are today.

Let’s change how we look at plant medicines

We don’t have to live in our pre-programmed scripts. We can choose to change how we look at these plants. 

We don’t have to lock people up for experimenting with their consciousness. We don’t have to criminalize the act of introspection and learning what it really means to be a human, discovering all the aspects of the human being.

We can turn this around just like we’re turning around the cannabis drug laws in America. Just like we overturned gay rights and civil rights and children’s rights and labor rights… our evolution as a society is grounded in the overturning of draconian laws put in place by people in power looking for more power and profit.

We, as the people of the Earth today, do not have to live this lie a single day longer. 

Computer technology is amazing, and I’m grateful for it because it’s allowing me to talk to you right now. But if we forget our natural technology, if we lose the wisdom of our ancestors and the gifts of the Earth, if we run too fast after cars and cash and forget about the Sun and Moon and our own breathing life force, if we get too smart and lose wisdom, then the penance put on our children rests solely with our inaction and ignorance.

This is not a diatribe to you my dear friend. If you’re reading this far I already count you as part of my tribe. No, this is a loving wake-up call. The time has come to change how we see plant medicines.

It’s already happening. You know this. The Ayahuasca trend is just the first shot fired. The wave of cannabis legalization is a sure-fire sign of the future brightening.

We have the momentum. Let’s push. Let’s lovingly learn and commune with more of these plant medicines. Learn from their wisdom and integrate it into your life.

I can attest. My life has dramatically – DRAMATICALLY – been enhanced, improved, completely transformed into a pure experience of light, every day, every second, from the time I started respecting and learning from these plant medicines.

They are my teachers. They tell me when my body is impure. The purge from Mother Jurema tells me I need to eat cleaner and meditate frequently. And I listen to her. I improve and come back to her and she rewards me with incredible love energy, a feeling of pure bliss on this sacred Earth, where just seeing the sunlight reflect off a tree is as spectacular as the explosion of galaxies. 

There is more to being human than shopping malls and clocking into work. Trust in Mother Earth. Trust that you have not finished your process. You are still evolving. We are still evolving. Our human family can get messy sometimes, as is true of any family, but we must remember to stay humble and realize that we don’t know everything, even with our iPhones and internet. 

--- Vision for the future ---

Forget nuclear bombs and the constant war machine. Don’t feed those concepts your precious life-energy.

Instead, give your energy to the positive. 

Imagine a future where every city has temples dedicated to the responsible use of plant medicines like Jurema and Ayahuasca.

Where depression disappears because people discover the magic of life from a single session of Jurema…

Where suicidal people can feel the hope that has lost them…

Where instead of corner-store cheap beer and liquor, our people can feel the experience that Jesus and Buddha speak of – feeling the experience, not reading about it – where our society starts to evolve consciously and can finally put in place all of the solutions we already have for climate change, free energy, free education and free food for all the people of this Earth…

Where the mighty and powerful human race can once again live symbiotically with its host planet, it’s life-giver, and turn the page on our current dark ages and run, gracefully, together, into the rising Sun of our future.

Our children deserve nothing less. ",Ayahuasca,"Plant Medicines are not Drugs, they are Technology"

1485,"Just some fun ideas to entertain here. 

I was watching this show *Mars* on the National Geographic channel, it's sort of half drama half documentary about how we might potentially start a permanent outpost on Mars within the not-too-distant future. 

They brought up experiments NASA has done simulating what it would be like for a small crew to spend well over a year in a confined spacecraft on the way to Mars, dealing with claustrophobia, cabin fever, stress and other psychological issues, and of course upon arriving at Mars, they would not be leaving anytime soon and would be pretty much isolated and left to fend for themselves against the elements there (on Mars both the temperature and atmospheric pressure are pretty much always trying to kill you it would seem). 

They locked test subjects up like this for the length of time required in order to study the psychological effects, they said that out of 6 subjects, 4 showed signs of serious issues by the end of the experiment. That doesn't bode well. 

So anyway, with that in mind, it occurred to me that it might make sense if one were to put the crew into a sort of ""semi-hibernation"" in order to reduce the perceived time spent travelling and hopefully improve psychological health in the process. You might use medications to induce sleep  for 16 hours a day or more, or at least 12 at the least. 

Of course I do wonder if it would be feasible to keep someone unconscious for almost the *entire trip* or if that would be too much to shoot for. 

You could conceivably do this with something like remeron perhaps, which is a very powerful long acting hypnotic that is nonaddictive, or perhaps with an antipsychotic, or rotating thru several different varieties of hypnotics to prevent tolerance to any one occurring.  

It would be interesting to see what's the max amount of sleep per day you can induce without causing too much negative effects. I take remeron myself and just half of a 15mg tab, the lowest dose they make, will make you sleep for 12-14 hours easy without a tolerance. I wonder if you could sleep as long as 24 hours without really stopping. I tend to find that after a point it becomes difficult to continue sleeping when you push the duration like that. 

Anyway I'm curious what your thoughts are on this. Would hibernation during long periods of space travel work out as it does in SF films? Or would there be unacceptable consequences? How could it be done effectively? 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I wonder how muscle atrophy would be affected. Already you will lose serious bone and muscle spending that much time in space even if you are exercising, it's worrisome to think how being in hibernation could compound that issue. Also, gravity on Mars is only 38% of earth's, so it's gonna be an ongoing issue. Though it's worth wondering whether you can make up for this simply by carrying extra weight on your person while on Mars, essentially making the load on your legs and frame closer to what it would be on earth and hopefully preserving your strength. 

Another idea, conceivably you could install a PICC line on each astronaut to allow easy IV access for hypnotics and perhaps partial parenteral nutrition as well, maybe with a catheter to collect urine as well. This would cut down on the amount of waking up you would have to do, allowing you to sleep much longer at a time. 

It would seem that chronobiology is also an essential aspect of understanding the mental issues that can arise during such a trip. Your biological rhythms are likely to be severely disturbed, hibernation or not. You would likely get the phenomenon know as ""free running"" sleep where you cease to sleep on a timely schedule based on the 24 hour day we evolved to deal with. Your sleeping patterns become erratic and the lack of synchronization of the body's internal clocks (of which the master piece is the superchiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus, aka the SCN) could lead to all kinds of hormone imbalances complicating things further. 

Perhaps you could help this by using a strict period of light and dark with those special lamps they give to people with seasonal affective disorder to imitate sunlight.  If you aren't aware, your SCN resets itself each morning when blue light from the sky hits your retinas as you wake up; some of the nerves in the eye travel directly to the SCN and cause a signal cascade to synchronize the chemical process by which the SCN keeps time, which involves a negative feedback loop of two sets of proteins stimulating, and then inhibiting the production of the other set, in an endless cycle.

1491,"I was wondering if it is plausable that daily CBD use would internalise the CB1 receptor causing both tolerance to THC and memory impairment?

Could not find much on this online

◇Background exerpt below◇

""CB1 is responsible for the immediate and psychoactive effects of marijuana, while CB2 determines the long-term and anti-inflammatory effects.

Using marijuana can lead to tolerance, which means more marijuana will be needed to achieve the same effect. Tolerance is caused by a process called internalization. When the CB1 receptor is internalized, it means it withdraws into the cell and can no longer come into contact with THC.

Internalization doesn’t just lead to marijuana tolerance. Other receptors associated with the CB1 receptor will follow CB1 into the cell. For example, the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor is internalized along with CB1. This leads to protective effects against anxiety and epilepsy, but it also causes the temporarily impaired memory retention associated with marijuana. ""

1505,"So this is the second time Ayahuasca has worked on me, though I have drank the tea quite often with 0 effects. My first time was horrific, I made a post about it here.

However, this Saturday I drank it again and it was kicking it quite nicely. I had prepared myself to just give in and watch whatever is shown to me. Saw the geometric patterns dancing and letting me in into a tunnel, where I saw more patterns just moving around. For a few seconds I saw a colorful snake right in front of me \(all visuals are with my eyes closed I should mention\) and felt there were snakes on my feet. Saw a few other things, but nothing scary and I was very calmed.

All this possibly lasted about 40 mins and I felt normal again, I was like okay this was good and decided to go sit down and drink some Gatorade, I've brought it with me in case I couldn't bear with the taste again. 

Was relaxed, was very sleepy and then I felt I needed to throw up. At that point I had a mixed feeling that maybe gatorade wasn't the smarted thing to have drank, so I figured I'd just throw up and that's all. I started to puke so much that I still had some Ayashuasca in my system. 

Puked so much that one of the helpers there came by and asked me if I was alright and if I wanted to drink water. So I accepted to drink water and as he speaking to me I thought I was going to faint... I felt fading away and I thought I was going to die because maybe I drank too much Ayahuasca and to top it all off I drank gatorade. I told him that I was feeling so dizzy, that I needed to sit down next to the fire place that was there. I could not feel my hands, face or feet. even near the fire. 

Closed my eyes and there must have been hundreds of images from now until the beginning of time, like it was showing me everything that ever existed, but had a bad feeling and opened my eyes.

I started to panic, I told him that I was scared that I needed to walk and have him by my side talking. He accepted and started to walk with me, but each time I heard his voice getting far and far away. I was so freaking scared, I regret drinking Ayahuasca again. I took my shoes off and started to walk through the grass and mud. I needed to feel alive I thought, I couldn't die intoxicated.

This went on for more than an hour, just frighting  for the rest of the early morning until the sun came up and I felt normal again.

I was in ecuador back packing with my boyfriend almost 2 years ago and we met a shaman that ended up having us over for a private ayahuasca ceremony. It was a beautiful property and he had a nice little set up for us. The fireflies even gave us a show before we started the ceremony. 

I remember drinking it and it took quite some time for the effects to take place. And in all honesty, I don't remember much. I remember seeing (eyes closed) alot of geometrical shapes and patterns, lots of distorted sounds until the shaman would play us some music from unknown instruments. I had visions of people in my life (deceased and still alive) and names (real names, instagram names). Most of the emotions I felt were positive. Love, happiness, nostalgia. 
Prior to this trip when my bf and I first started seeing eachother we had a bit of a rough patch because of his ex. And during my trip it felt like mother ayahuasca was trying to help me heal from it. Telling me I could trust him and that we wouldn't go through something like that again. This was the closest thing to a ""negative"" (but actually a positive) feeling I had.
I had visions of less fortunate countries of the world. Places where fresh drinking water isn't readily available. Places that don't have money, nice clothes or nice houses. I didn't feel sad for them, but it showed me how truly lucky we are to live where we live.
The last part of my trip, I became the earth itself. I was soil. And I could feel myself sprout from the ground and growing into green grass. I started feeling my ""body"" getting ripped apart. Then I saw a cows mouth take a bite out of me. I was seeing a cow eat grass (me). It began mooing which got louder and louder and sounded like it was in distress. I opened my eyes and I began to purge. This was how my trip ended. 

I've read so many stories about these life changing experiences that people have had from doing ayahuasca. Like this drink turned their world upside down and how crazy these visions were. I'm still trying to sort mine out. I barely even understand it. I have noticed subtle changes in my life, like my diet. I've almost completely stopped eating red meat as it makes me super sick feeling when I do. I'm much more at peace with life and how things happen and to just let it happen.

1530,"I watched this last night at a solid 7. I was fascinated by the guy's descriptions of depression. I've never seen it described so well. The utter futility of it all.

Anyway, on to my questions.

It seems like shaman he chose to go with, the ""Last"" one, is an elusive and real shaman. So many of the shamans are hawking Ayahuasca like street vendors might. Yelling it at you and trying to entice you to spend your money with them. The points I think I took away from the movie are that an actual shaman isn't going to try to milk you for all your money. There might be some expenses involved but the experience with a genuine healer will be one focused on healing and not separating you from your money. Something else I think I learned was the healing process isn't a weekend or week long ayahuasca binge. It's a very long process (I think this guy was there for 9 months+) full of suffering and humility and work. Enough to reset your thoughts and to, apparently to me, bring your expectation level down low enough as to allow you to be happy with what you have.

This is something I have long pondered. I believe a lot of depression is actually social/environmental (as well as chemical to be sure). I think people are getting into their heads, they need or want so much more than they actually need. Commercialism seems to really drive this. If people can get reset back to a lower level of expectation, perhaps the brain chemistry can correct itself.

Ok, so I guess I still haven't asked any questions. Here's one. Is the Aya window closing? Is it too late to go to Peru and find a real shaman for real healing? It appears they stopped the shaman who was ""giving"" it away and banished him to the city where the shamans are all behaving the same, yelling their Aya and collecting money. It seems to me, the shamans in Peru no longer care (the organised and easily located ones) about healing anyone. They're drug dealers now. Nothing more. Is it still possible to find a genuine healer and not put him in danger by soliciting his assistance?

It seems like the trip to Peru really helped this young man and while I'm not desperate enough yet with my depression to attempt a very, very long trip to Peru, I still want to know if it's there as an option and if the option is shrinking or if it will still be an option in 5 years.",Ayahuasca,The Last Shaman on Netflix.

I have had a constantly changing mindset/mood/energy level since my retreat, and am still tinkering with what need's to be done to make sure I don't forget the lessons. One week I felt very strong/focused/confident/happy but that has diminished greatly, and I feel myself slipping back to my old self and habits. I am trying hard to get back to that state.

Some things that I'm trying to do (nothing revolutionary) to integrate:

\- Journal in the morning/night (\~20 min total): It is probably the biggest help.

\- Meditate: This one is hard. Even though I was a big meditator before, I am struggling with doing it post aya. 

\- Goals/Scheduling activities: Instead of loosely planning fun activities or ones related to personal development, I make sure I put it in the calendar and commit (be it paying for it or inviting others to it)

\- Getting rid of the idea that there is a 'future me': I use to procrastinate on things because I thought the 'future me' would be better equipped to handle some of the goals I wanted to pursue (i,e, don't do an improv class now, do it in 1 month when youll be more relaxed/confident to do it).

So I don't care if I have to move to another country honestly to be able to do something legally. I really don't care about myself (not that I have a death wish, I just accept it as something natural) but I don't want my family to suffer at the same time.

So I'm familiar with thienodiazepines which seem to be easier to obtain than benzos and mixing something up to take orally or for sublingual use is as simple as frying an egg. Phenobarbitol synthesis wouldn't be out of the question except not only is it clearly illegal where I live but even if I didn't care the smell would alert neighbors too much.

My primary concern is if I go into status again. I've thought of various ways for intramuscular injection to intravenous but the needle would very likely break off which I mean wouldn't be the worst thing in the muscle. Better to have surgery to remove it I suppose compared to dying.

Anyway, a PG or Iso solution isn't too awful of an idea but the chances of me inhaling them while seizing are rather high so also not the most practical.

This leaves transdermal, the safest was I can think of for a family member to try to abort a massive seizure if it were to happen again. I'm lucky to have survived the last and without any brain damage especially.

I know thienodiazepines are generally soluble in isopropyl alcohol especially at high concentrations. Thing is, it evaporates very fast as I'm sure many people are aware.

I was thinking of mixing it at a low ratio with some propylene glycol to lower the evaporation rate.   


I'm willing to test on myself if needed because honestly in low amounts this is all fairly benign. I would however prefer to not have to waste the potential ""ingredients"" if needed and testing could take a while because I'd want to wait long in between to avoid any potential tolerance skewing the results.

This article states that serotonin is an inhibitory molecule and LSD is a partial agonist and this causes ""disinhibition."" How does this work? How do different molecules affecting the same receptor produce different effects?

I briefly went through this paper to understand the pharmacological difference between agonists and antagonists, but I'm still having understanding why two different molecules that bind to the same receptor produce vastly different effects. Could my fellow redditors help me out?

EDIT: These are some fascinating responses that certainly helped me in finding answers! Here's a direct quote from the Wikipedia article on functional selectivity:

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_selectivity
""One notable example of functional selectivity occurs with the 5-HT2A receptor, as well as the 5-HT2C receptor. Serotonin, the main endogenous ligand of 5-HT receptors, is a functionally selective agonist at this receptor, activating phospholipase C (which leads to inositol triphosphate accumulation), but does not activate phospholipase A2, which would result in arachidonic acid signalling. However, the other endogenous compound dimethyltryptamine activates arachidonic acid signaling at the 5-HT2A receptor, as do many exogenous hallucinogens such as DOB and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). Notably, LSD does not activate IP3 signaling through this receptor to any significant extent. Oligomers; specifically 5-HT2A–mGluR2 heteromers mediate this effect. This may explain why some direct 5-HT2 receptor agonists have psychedelic effects, whereas compounds that indirectly increase serotonin signalling at the 5-HT2 receptors, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), generally do not; nor do 5HT2A receptor agonists without constitutive activity at the mGluR dimer, such as lisuride.""

So it appears that different ligands trigger different downstream signaling cascades in the cell. This is really interesting!

I took the liberty of condensing this recent Ayahuasca study to make the findings easily accessible. Published in the journal of Scientific Reports, researchers at University of Exeter and University College London reported:

• People who used ayahuasca in the past year reported lower levels of problematic alcohol use than those who had taken LSD or psilocybin mushrooms. 

• Ayahuasca users also reported higher levels of well-being than both their psychedelic-using peers and those who don’t use psychedelics at all.

• Findings suggest this “Shaman’s Brew” might also offer a treatment for depression.

• Recent research has demonstrated ayahuasca’s potential as a psychiatric medicine, and our current study provides further evidence that it may be a safe and promising treatment.”

• Researchers also wrote that long-term ayahuasca use does not seem to negatively affect cognitive abilities, and it isn’t associated with addictive use or worsening mental health issues.

• “In religious work, long-term ayahuasca use has not been found to impact on cognitive ability, produce addiction or worsen mental health problems.”

• “Some observational studies suggest that ayahuasca use is associated with less problematic alcohol and drug use, and better mental health and cognitive functioning.”

1546,"Hi all, 

As I  journeyed more frequently this year, I have noticed that my dreams in general have become quite vivid and, well, interdimensional. One really interesting phenomenon is that I always have very intense and interdimensional dreams when my ayahuasca community is in ceremony \(and I'm not there\). Also, the dreams on those nights tend to be distinct from regular random dreaming \- I'm always on another planet, in the future or travelling through different planes of reality, or in a very mythical land on some sort of quest. It's happened so many times that abuela presents herself before I even realize what day it is. Just a few nights ago, I laid down to go to sleep, closed my eyes, and thought ""wow, I am having a lot of psychedelic patterns and movement come into my inner vision,"" then shortly after I realized that my circle was probably deep with the medicine at that moment. Perhaps the dates of ceremony are just resting in my subconscious, but I think that the channels between me and Aya are still open, to some degree. It seems like I am more often on dieta than off it, so that could be related.

I returned yesterday from a retreat in Peru where I did seven ceremonies. As stated in the general guidelines, you are supposed abstain from sexual activity for a minimum of two weeks including masturbation.

Now, I have neither had sex nor masturbated, but today, six days after my last ceremony, my ignorant curiosity got the best out of me as I browsed a few non-hardcore sites to sort of see what I had ""missed"". 

The most explicit content I came across was a picture of a topless woman, but during my session, which lasted maybe 15 minutes, I mainly looked at posts containing links to the material and if I chose to click the link, I squinted my eyes only to see the silhuette of the image. 

My reaction to the imagery was different than before - I never became genuinly aroused by this, it was more a cognitive interest if you could put it that way. Now however, I am just terrified that I might have made a big mistake. An hour or two afterwards I felt a slight physical sensation in my nether regions, but it was not of arousal.

I don't take them now, but struggling with depression I have come to see that exercise seems to do a decent enough job of quelling depressive feelings (though for some people they need medication due to symptom severity). 

Antidepressants do work for some patients, fewer than most in the psychiatric community will admit. Nevertheless it really bothers me how liberally they are prescribed given that they too have their own dependence liability. Sure, they aren't addicting in the sense that people go to the street to find more if they run out, but they likely turn to illicit drugs or alcohol to fill that void. 

Antidepressants do demonstrate withdrawal symptoms upon abruptly ceasing therapy with them. Many patients appear to have to be tapered off them once the time has come for them to stop taking them. What class of drug does this sound like? Benzodiazapines? After all, they too demonstrate similar withdrawal effects. Yet, those are considered habit forming (which I don't dispute) while antidepressants aren't (they call withdrawal symptoms ""discontinuation syndrome"").

1570,"Hey guys.
Let me tell You a story.

Here was this guy, Eastern European, same as all thinking, with bad habits- be it drugs, alcohol, cigs, swearing, You name it. No big deal. His only biggest hobby and closest thing to heart was videogames, which helped him to find shelter from loneliness during teenage period. Really interested in mind altering substances. Always trying new stuff with priorly found info about harm reduction. 

There was this period in each country when absurdly big amounts of RCs started to flow in and, of course, this dude had to try them all. Long story short, nothing from locally avaible stuff was to his liking- be it bad side effects, duration, effects,  availability. Decided to stick with weed, alcohol and cigs.

And then, one beautiful day, a fuckingly retarted thought came across him: “I should fucking google a list of strongest/strangest/most interesting drugs!!” 

And lo and behold, he stumbled upon DMT and Ayahuasca. All the information about it made him shocked. Such strange drug, it’s intensity, so mytic. This stuff occupied his head. He was sure, that it was something, that he was searching in drugs all his life.

....BUT...he soon forgot about it

After some life changing events, getting kicked out of home, years go by, yada, yada, yada. Dude finally starts to live normaly, marries, has a kid. BOOM. He stumbles on DMT once again. Well sure his substance abuse hasn’t stopped, but now he does everything with moderation- a pill, tab, powder or drink once a month or sometimes...more often, so he thinks: “What the heck, I should finally do this stuff!”

He got himself Acacia Confusa and Syrian rue. Extracting stuff was straight no-no as he was living in a big family where only wife knew about his drug “hobby” so he settled with powdered Ayahuasca route.

And let me tell You, his first experience was THE BOMB. Euphoria, visuals, mind twisting and something else. This drug made his fucking soul HIGH. Nothing like classical drugs. And most important, You can’t get hooked up on it, no bad side effects, it’s cheap. He fucking couldn’t imagine anything better. Well, sure thing, he did learn to respect Aya in hard way. After few unfaithul trips, where he dived in with bad intentions, he did start to get some side effects:  paranoia, anxiety. Nothing really serious, but still. Took some months to get his head straight. He started to respect his teacher plants, tried to make his trips productive, teaching. Some things did start to change, like his character and habbits. He gets moral boost, his soul starts to feel happy...

Sure, some bad intentions do stay, like upping the dosage to trip harder. Meh.

But after his last trip he started having second thoughts: what if, accidentally, his dosage of acacia get too big and he ends up fucked in the head or with schizophrenia, or even worse. His last trip was hard on his psyche, he thought that he even might loose his bananas. No bad side effects. Still came out of it fresh and clean with big boost. 

Just to add, no brain disorders in his family.
Now this thing occupies his thoughts. How he should progress?

I've been thinking about terpenes lately and began to wonder: has anyone experimented with taking terpenes before smoking/vaping/eating weed? Terpenes seem to modulate the activity of THC and CBD and are responsible for the differences between different strains. The details of this modulation are not well understood.

We're all familiar with eating mangos before smoking weed in order to enhance/intensify/extend the high. Mangoes contain myrcene, a terpene that is found in high levels in indica strains but not sativa strains. Thus it is believed that myrcene is at least partially responsible for the body high/couch lock that indicas generally provide. I'm not sure how much myrcene the average mango contains, but it must be quite a lot to change the high as much as mangos can do.

So, mangos are cool, but what about other terpenes? I've read that Jack Herer contains high levels of pinene, another terpene. You can buy pinene and other terpenes [online for cheap](https://www.buyterpenesonline.com/terpenes-for-sale/alpha-pinene/?attribute_pa_size=4-oz&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAt4rfBRBKEiwAC678KdZyJUMrDvmFM_oTaaJEio8SDlNLLWpiTeTzAEH1ZGTd-LRUg-k11xoC5q0QAvD_BwE) (this is just the first link I found, no idea if it's legitimate). I'm sure people here or elsewhere have added these pure terpenes to concentrates to recreate their favorite strains. But what about dosing relatively large amounts of a given terpene (akin to eating several mangos) before consuming weed? Does anyone here have experience with that?

The second cup was an hour and a half after the first. After the second cup, I noticed my breathing had changed. It wasn’t labored but it took concentration. 

I was using the bathroom and noticed I was getting confused and had to concentrate on breathing. It was the middle of the night tho and the aya was kicking in. I dozed off. When I woke up, it was with a jolt. I was full of panic, my vision was fading, I felt moments from passing out, and my pulse was extremely weak. I asked for help and felt truly terrified for my life. As I breathed, my body gradually recovered. I felt fearful, shameful, but as long as I focused on breathing I was okay. A couple hours after that I felt more or less okay, just shaken by the experience.

Any ideas what could have happened? I’ve been reading about contraindications and this doesn’t seem to map to the most common interactions. It was not serotonin syndrome. Most other interactions seem to cause hypertensive crisis, not the trouble breathing and then hypotensive crisis I went through. I did take some supplements that day, including coenzyme q10. Could that be the culprit? It’s not listed as contraindicative.

1579,"I am approaching my very first ceremony, it is set on the 4th of May.  In preparation for the ceremony I have taken great lengths. I have been following the diet strictly. Routinely do different yoga and breathwork, meditation, sound therapy. Journaling and contemplating. Immersing myself in nature.

I am from the Philippines, and for this preparation ""dieta"" I have gone out of town, to an island which is called ""Mystic Island"".

Its called that because of its traditional healing methods, herbalists, and lastly occultists, who practice a magic traditon long before colonial times. 

In a nutshell this island is full of healers and witch doctors. There is an abundance of good energy and dark energies. 

I am wise enough to stay away from all sorts of dark energies and witch doctors anf their rituals/spells. 

However I am very very much entertaining the thought of trying the healing practices. I know to stay away from the herbal stuff as it could interfere with my physiological system.

I am not doing it out of pure curiosity, but because in the past weeks here I have- gotten an ear problem, possible infection. Itchy bites all over my skin. Re-dislocated my shoulder. All problems which my trusted local friends have told me through stories can be healed or at least helped by the healers.

Specifically here are the ""magical"" healing practices, which I want to be done are:

1) Traditional massage - the healers are very aware of the healing power of touch and very knowledgable on the flows of energies in the body. They also have special liniment made from things they gather from the forest. This could help my shoulder.


2) Water (bubble) cleansing - A method of curing ailments. Cleanses the body from ""impurities"". Most healers are given this power through divine powers accoridng to them. For example, they would be instructed by God or mother mary through dreams. Even the tools they use for this method, they claim were given to them in similar circumstances.
This could help my skin and ear problems.


3) Smoke bad energy and bad spirit cleansing. A special smoke they perform the therapy on your body to ""chase away bad spirits"". To cleanse you from evil forces/ energies. (Usually in the context of when a witch doctor has put an evil/bad spell on you).
This, I think compliments Ayahuasca.

I should also clarify, that the witch doctors and healers are mostly the same people. Most if not all healers (people with healing power) in this island also have the power for dark things (curses, maladies, voodoo stuff). 

And before you say this is for gullible tourists. There is an aspect to that. There are ""healers"" for tourists. There are fake potions they sell. But the real healers &amp; witch doctors. Who are hard to find as they tend to be secret, the locals dont like sharing this information. They charge nothing for their services/powers. (However it is believed by the local people that when healers ""give"" their powers, you must give them something in return, food, money, anything but you must give as well)

For the record, I dont totally ""believe"" in these things. I am unsure as to how ""real"" these things really are. But I keep an open mind and I have heard enough testimonies, and can honestly feel the ""realness"" of these things to make me think theres something to these things. Maybe energies? Maybe psyche? Maybe spirits? Really hard to tell.

Since Ayahuasca intersects with the realm of spirits, the mystical/mythical, other dimensions, or whatever. I think I have to be careful.

1586,"As I was networking to find an internship in the cocoa sector of Peru I got into contact with José, a member of the Shipibu family near Pucallpa. Even though I had made an internship in Piura region, we still held contact. When I expressed my interest in their culture and ayahuasca, he invited me to visit him in his house in Pucallpa.

After a journey of 1,5 day (from my rural town in Piura), I arrived at at the airport. We went to his house and I got to meet his family, we would visit 2 communities in the next day and have 2 ceremonies at José's home. The next day we left for the first community, where we'd meet up with José's uncle and return home with him. After 1 hour of travel by car and boat, we arrived at a resort with huts on the outskirts of a small town. Here, the uncle said that I was invited to partake in the ceremony there with them.

As it became evening, I became a bit nervous. It didn't make me sick, but I was aware that I would step into the unknown soon. At 8 pm it was time to enter the ceremony building. It was a big hut (the size of a small classroom) with a roof of dry leaves and 360 degrees open windows with mosquito nets. In the far distance a storm creates flashes of light, the thunder did not reach us. After a while of patient waiting, the group was complete. There were 9 people in the room, 5 of them were Shamans. Once if them decided it was time and commenced to pour the medine and bless the servings.

I made myself comfortable and tried to concentrate. There was no purge with any of us, but I did leave the room to urinate for about 3 times that night. It was as of the medicine chose my kidneys to dispose of the venom. After about 45 minutes the first Shaman started singing, others would soon follow. It took me a while to learn to appreciate it, but the reward was big. There were two moments when all of them sang at the same time. It surprised me that the singing was not harmonic, but chaotic, with each shaman singing their own song. It's like navigating in the jungle with no clear path. It soon became clear to me that partaking in the tradition itself offered a stable pathway through the night. 
By now, the medicine was in effect. The trip was gentle and allowed for many different thoughts. I prepared a long time to confront my inner resentfullness, but this felt to complicated to tackle. My mind rendered itself more useful for topics as friends and pop-culture. The shamans would move around in the dark room and sit in front of us to sing songs. It's hard to describe how this really affects you. I concentrated on the medicine and allowed my body to wobble along on the rytm. 
Questions became really powerful. As soon as they have been asked or thought of, there would be a sequence of reactionary thoughts that were partially predetermined, this occurred in seconds after the question. This seemed to be the ""ayahuasca-effect"" to me, the most distinctive trait of the medicine that I have not experienced before. If I got anything from this first experience, it is to ask with caution. I think there are two aspects that are fundamental to not let this effect spiral out of control. Firstly, you have to do your homework. In order to navigate through your soul, you need to have mapped it out sufficiently. And secondly, tell the truth. The lie has infinite potential follow-ups, and will unavoidably lead to the void. Which is also unavoidable to do, but you can at least try not to expose yourself to it unnecessarily. 

When the candle was lit, I stayed for about an half an hour more and talked a bit with the shamans, they said that they worked on removing my bourders. José's uncle said that I responded quite well and that a slightly increased dose would be good for me. He will host my second and last session this Sunday. 


I want to add to this that there is an idea that has kept me quite busy the last couple of months and it certainly helped me during the ceremony. 
The book of Genesis in the bible tells of how the world had been created by God. He spoke being into existence by creating order out of chaos. Of all the different ways that this could have happened, it was speech that were the most powerful to the Christian God. This implies that the true word, is a word of magic with the potential to generate structure as you move forward into time and space. 
I don't consider myself a true practicing Christian, but the biblical old testament stories have received my respect lately due to their psychological significance. ",Ayahuasca,First ayahuasca with the Shipibu

1590,"I've drunk Ayahuasca from 5 different chefs for a total of 11 times (Pisac, Iquitos, London, purchased online and a homebrew). All of these I would describe as little to no effects, to moderate. The moderate one was my last in Peru and was kind of like when you have visuals as you're going to sleep (sober) but more intense and a very strong energetic feeling, it was a really nice experience overall however. The others in Peru had some fairly visual parts but these soon faded.

I should mention also that it didn't take me deep to have anything profound happen.

One more thing to mention is that I've had profound experiences on dmt, mushrooms and lsd and while these can't be compared like for like, I think they still give me a good comparison to know what is and what isn't a strong experience.

Anyway, onto the main question. I'm going back to South America next year and am wanting to drink Ayahuasca again/ I've made a list and have found that Kapitari seems to be the best value for money.

I am slightly concerned at some of the reviews that say the brews are weak as I don't really want to repeat what happened last time. It was still a good time, but I just want to experience what Ayahuasca has done for so many others.

Can anyone vouch for Kapitari, or know of anywhere else I would get a guaranteed strong brew? I say strong meaning something that will do the job, I'm not necessarily looking for some crazy moonshine style aya.

I've read that finding a local shaman would be one of the best ways, as it would be cheap and legit, no messing around. The danger here is falling into the trap of money hungry scammers.

Please help me if you can!

Just to end off here, I have a feeling that some shamans give gringos weaker brews to keep them there for longer, in case they freak out or get what they came for in one go, although the latter wouldn't make sense in a retreat package where you pay for a number of ceremonies. I was also told over and over that it's working in the background which I completely understand but again just adds to my suspicions that the brews are kept below a certain threshold. My friend was also with me for all of these sessions apart from the homebrew, and he had similar experiences.",Ayahuasca,Legit retreats in South America

NOTE TO READERS:  please make sure to do thorough research first, there are great legitimate, scientific sources to read from.  Taking the wrong dose of Naltrexone could send you into precipitated withdrawals if you still have opioids in your system.

I used to take 6gpd of kratom divided in 2 3g doses twice a day.  I never got interdose withdrawals and could go 12 hours feeling fine.   One day I had the great idea of trying to get off kratom using tianeptine.  Tianeptine is much more powerful than kratom at high doses and I ended up on a 7 week tianeptine binge.  After those 7 weeks, I tried to get back on Kratom.  My tolerance had been destroyed by the tianeptine...I was taking up to 60gpd and not feeling anything, and if I didn't dose every 4 hours I'd go into interdose withdrawals.

I tried every tool I could find, because my tolerance wasn't going down.  I tried agamatine, memantine, bso, nightly therapeutic doses of dxm...nothing worked.  Only uldn has worked.  A few days after I started taking it, I noticed I could go longer between doses.  Eventually I stabilized at 20gpd, and then that's when I ramped it up since I hadn't experienced any wd while tapering.  Once I was at 20g, I dropped 9g in 18 days, and the last 7g in 7 days until I got to 4g (2 doses of 2g per day).  The following day I forgot to take my morning dose.  Then I forgot to take my evening dose.  I figured I might as well jump at that point.  

It's almost been 72hrs since my last 2g dose.  All I feel is a bit tired, but nothing else.  No cold chills, hot flashes, rls.

If anyone is serious about tapering, quitting, or just keep their tolerance in check.  I highly suggest you research uldn and the appropriate dose to take (taking too much can cause precipitated withdrawals).  Based on all the research I've done, uldn is the only clinically proven chemical than can reduce tolerance.

Always do your research, as taking higher than uldn doses can cause precipitated if you still have opioids in your system.  But at ultra low doses it's not enough to rip opioids off your receptor (causing precipitated withdrawals), but it still antagonizes your opioid receptors, essentially making them more sensitive so that you require a lower dose for the same effect (tolerance reduction).  Additionally, after the naltrexone leaves (in ~2-3 hours), the rebound effect is an increase in endorphins.

You can use uldn to reduce tolerance while you're taking opioids and ldn once you've quit in order to heal your receptors quicker and shorten withdrawal.  Ldn also helps with depression and pain.

Do PM me if you have questions.

1594,"Hey everyone,

I'm posting here because I think it is the most fitting sub. 

So a year or so ago I got off of ssri medication. I took a low dose of cipralex to help with anxiety. Before I took it i was somewhat of a wreck.. always worrying about things, never being able to just be comfortable with my self. I always felt off around people, like just really over thinking things. 

I got off the meds a year ago and did about 8 aya ceremonies. They helped lots and opened up new perspectives for me. Since then I've taken part in an iboga ceremony and just did my first kambo ceremony a month ago. 

I've been working with a therapist as well and have moved to a new province. A lot of change has gone on within but I still find myself falling back into this worry. It's worry that seems to keep me from being in a relationship, like I just can't get myself to trust that a relationship will work out. 

 When I was on meds, at least I could be a little closer to people, I could talk and stay calmer with people. Right now it's just so hard to spend time with ppl sometimes. I just feel drained and like I'm always working. I was able to maintain emotional stability during relationships and was able to spend time with women without my insecurities totally dominating. It's interesting to note that my grandma was going to leave my grandpa unless he took medication because I guess he was that difficult to be around. 

So my question to you guys is, have you ever gone back to ssris after working with plant medicines? I understand suppressing things with a pill won't set me free but at some point I'm just tired from so much inner and outer work, I could use a break. And it would nice to feel capable of being in a relationship again. I welcome your thoughts

First I took one dose, and waited for something to happen. We were told that if we had never tried it before, we shouldn't combine it with weed because the effect could be too powerful. I had never tried weed either, and smoked a little. Still nothing. Then I became sick and wanted to vomit, but nothing came out. Gradually it went away, and then I tried another cup of ayahuasca. The same thing happened again, except that I was sick for a much longer time.

I prefer most people be more like him, but for myself, I want to be more grounded. This was my concern with trying aya.

There was however a lot of people getting offended and even trying to psychoanalyze me, off of no information whatsoever. I'm beginning to think that aya may make some people more sensitive or easily rattled. I have read stories of people who did aya and afterward I read many were horrified at the world and how we treat it. It was like a sudden realization of the crimes of humanity.

****

Methylphenidate (MPD; Ritalin/Concerta and d-MPD; Focalin) is the most commonly prescribed ADHD medication worldwide. It is considered to be highly effective for ADHD treatment.

However, one of the downsides of chronic MPD use is its abuse potential. Since MPD is a dopamine reuptake inhibitor (DRI), it also has rewarding/reinforcing effects, which can lead to addiction in predisposed individuals. The mechanism of action of Methylphenidate is similar to this of Cocaine, and accordingly, in high doses, they are reported to have similar subjective effects.

Modafinil is one of the most commonly used nootropic drugs, and it has 2 main mechanisms of action: Dopamine reuptake inhibition, as well as CNS Histamine receptor agonist activity. The subjective reported effects of Modafinil are in accordance with its mechanisms of action. Modafinil's DRI activity has previously raised a concern: Can it be addictive like other DRIs?

The paper above, from 2011, has found that while Modafinil is a DRI, it works differently compared to Cocaine-Like DRIs (MPD &amp; Cocaine). While MPD &amp; Cocaine bind the dopamine transporter (DAT) in such a way that reverses dopamine transport (thus releasing dopamine)^[[1]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0028390814002342?via%3Dihub)[[2]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3684841/) , Modafinil does not. In that sense, Modafinil is a ""pure"" DRI, while MPD &amp; Cocaine also induce dopamine release by reversing the direction of the DAT.

The lack of dopamine release with Modafinil might therefore mean a lack of rewarding/reinforcing effects (leading to a lower abuse potential), which are presumably apparent with MPD &amp; Cocaine due to their ability to release dopamine.

While this study was in vitro, it is possible that this could translate to lower abuse potential of Modafinil in vivo (rodents, and later possibly humans too), compared to this of MPD &amp; Cocaine.",DrugNerds,"Non-addictive ADHD treatment?

Its there and waiting to be acknowleded and let go when ever im ready to look. I've been able to really tap into the place inside where its not ok. Whatever has ever been not ok in this life its all there, boiled down to its essence, simply ""not ok"". No thought story needed. The real not ok. The one you gotta acknowlege to really dissolve the issue. Oh my, it never shows you more than you can handle but sometimes you suprise yourself just how much you can take. Its such a beautifully painful cleasing rejuvenating experience. I had a very safe space to let go in. Crying, screaming, laughing, moaning, really letting it out.

1645,"The medical community is under the impression greatly that gabapentinoids like gabapentin and pregabalin (Lyrica) are relatively safer than benzodiazepines as a treatment for anxiety, even though anxiolytic uses for the gabapentinoids are off label and a direct result of inhibition of excitatory neurotransmitters via calcium subunit activation. These drugs are also used in patients with addiction history specifically alcohol/benzodiazepines. 

Many people who use gabapentinoids long term talk about a severe withdrawal. I suppose this can be attributed to a decreased response to endogenous activation of the calcium sub unit. Studies also clearly show that these drugs prevent synaptogenesis which to me is one of the most prevalent side effects I can think of long term. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/29338087/

With benzodiazepines we do notice a decreased cerebral density over a long term that does not necessarily indicate neurotoxicity but at least down regulation of GABAa receptors. Also the withdrawals with this class of drugs is highly known and can cause horrendous effects to the user. 

What I’m really trying to get at is what do you all think about these two classes of drugs in terms of their long term efficacy and whether or not one is “safer” than the other to the brain in that long span. As well as, which causes the most problems concerning ending treatment long term.

I understand we are all biochemically and emotionally unique, but man, after my experience I am so intrigued how people can go back for more the day or so after.

Maybe my trip was 'worse' than I think, but I didn't think it was 'bad'. Some past traumas came up, I think I repressed ( abusive father) I remember breathing the most relieving breath ever, like fire coming out once that past an I 'accepted' it? I I think. It felt wonderful either way. Like letting out a huge shit to be graphic. A release. I realised I could breath. 

Other than this, the ride was pretty nice, had some amazing insights into consciousness. How it culminates in the brain, but it is external from the brain. 

Felt my brain crash, stop and 'reboot'. Everything I ever knew thought saw, symbols colours shapes etc was all fragmented, entirely separate without connections, and I floated in this world for a while but being able to actually touch any train of thought at all, and trying just made the thoughts disappears. But I wasn't afraid, I enjoyed it, and I'm quite a highly strung person. 

There were some other tales but I'm digressing. I took some notes. Drew a lizards? Saw a reptilian eye Perhaps a reference to the reptilian brain deep with? 

The post 3 days I'm feeling pretty 'off'. I'm trying to digest it all. I'm struggling to sleep slightly. And the thought that if I did this at a retreat and had to go back for more today would feel me with dread, or though I would like to go back.  Like force feeding myself after a buffet.

Overall it felt like 2 years of therapy and mediation in one night combined with a fever, and I'm willing to accept this is all part of the process, but dam, I don't feel quite right.

However, if this is true about ayahuasca, I don't want to partake in the ceremony and then join the circle talk in the morning having not slept a second. It would diminish the experience.

1659,"I'd like to try Ayahuasca, but I'm not sure if I'm ready or whether it's a good idea or not. 

I have been struggling with my identity for over a decade. I won't go into a lot of detail, but essentially I feel fragmented. I can't seem to feel like just one person. I don't actually have Dissociative Identity Disorder (Multiple Personalities), or believe that I am more than one person, but I can't seem to identify with myself. When I look in the mirror, it looks like a stranger. I feel too much into other people and I can't stick with any personality traits. I just feel like I'm multiple, contradicting things at once and it's very painful. 

I have taken LSD twice, about 3 years ago. This is what made me interested in spirituality. Since then, I have been meditating near enough every day for around an hour, which has produced beautiful results. Aside from that though, I've no experience with drugs or altered states of consciousness. My second LSD trip was very traumatising, but it triggered an intense spiritual awakening. I'm still very nervous to trip again, because I felt at the time like I was on the brink of going a bit mad. I'm really scared to feel that again, so I have a lot of fear regarding tripping.

The reason I'm considering it at all is because I have been struggling with this God-awful feeling of fragmentation for so long now and I feel like I've exhausted a lot of other options. I have been to therapists, who suggested that I look into Borderline Personality Disorder. I feel like this is accurate, but also I feel like the reason I feel this way might be because of spiritual reasons too. I have seen medical doctors, been to a shaman, I've tried hypnotherapy, I've tried years of meditation and reflection and the problem just isn't going away. I'm just not sure what else to try. 

I feel like there is kind of a chance that I'd be prone to a mental breakdown of some kind, which is what's stopping me from doing it right away. I experienced a lot of paranoia with my second trip. 

I'm not really sure what I'm asking exactly. Does anyone have any advice?

1665," Long story short... Long story short I smoked some DMT at a new acquaintance's house in a place I've never been.  I smoked it twice at his place (free-based) and the second time I had intense closed eye visuals and the sense of what I can only describe as a ""gatekeeper"". I did not go further.  Came home, then went out to have a couple of beers with a dear friend before returning home again. I found some good, traditional ayahuasca music on youtube, then loaded a little DMT with hash and lit it with a match... nothing. I loaded a bowl of weed with a fair amount of DMT and lit it with a lighter. The closest description I can think of is that for a moment I felt possessed and my hands were moving all across my head and body in a repeating pattern with these super intense closed eye visuals. No direct contact with any beings but the clear sense of a message that I was not aware of the forces I was dealing with. I felt aware of this presence and the actions of my body but an almost complete lack of control over the movements. As I came out of it I got this sense that ...please take this as hyperbole because I do not want to go into detail of what exactly I think this may or may not refer to... I know enough. Definitely not the experience I was expecting. Will be taking some time to consider it before choosing my next step. Would appreciate any cases/examples of similar experiences if you know of any. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was seeing this intense image of hands and feet (they were ""real"" looking at first then quickly shifted to a cartoonish or exaggerated version of hands and feet with lots of colors and shades) moving over each other like some sort of cheesey animated gif border, at times they seemed to move in a pattern like the infinity symbol, hands chasing feet... The thing that was so powerful was the speed with which my body attempted to duplicate what I was seeing by going into the motions I described. There was a spark of an idea that I was dead, this is what being dead is... that's when this reactionary response began, without a recognition of fear or concern, and my hands started feeling my head and body in this very fast, repeated pattern which I was being shown.   
My biggest concern stems from the potential for a psychotic break. I do not know of any (immediate) family history of psychosis. I have never been diagnosed with any severe mental issues. My first psychedelic experience was in my early twenties and it was a mind-shredder. I got through that without causing harm to myself or anyone and have gone on fine (more or less) for many years after. I took some acid not too long ago and during that trip I got this profound sense that I needed to/will eventually stop smoking weed (I smoked many joints everyday)... shortly after I learn from my doctor that I was developing mild asthma. That leaves me wondering... was this experience a warning, telling me that for me to go further will cause a severe physical/mental reaction that I may not be able to come back from? Was it me still recovering from the intensity of my encounter with this new person -- he has strong feelings about some very confrontational issues? Was it something else? I felt I had gone into this with the right intentions... I'm not trying to ""party"" or ""get high"". I want to explore and experience the things people speak about when they are on these substances. I want to learn what else we may/may not have access to while living this life. I'm curious, and fearful, to encounter other beings and dimensions the way I've heard others describe. However, I'm left with this feeling that I'm either stuck at the door or way overshot my mark (not an uncommon theme for me).   
After listening to so many people's stories and dealings with plant based medicines I have this sense that an individual's experience is a message for them and their life. If I'm wrong or misguided in my thoughts that's one thing to look at. If I'm right, then I'm not sure why the fuck my experiences were telling me what they were saying last night.

The chances of contracting malaria during your stay are pretty minimal especially as the disease-carrying ones bite predominantly during the night and you definitely will not  be going for jungle walks after the sun has gone down. If you choose to take some form of prophylactic malaria treatment, that is, of course, YOUR choice but we recommend against it as it could interfere with your work with the medicinal plants (in our experience the anti-malarial drugs often induce worse symptoms than the disease itself).

&gt; Vaccinations – Although you will undoubtedly be advised to take several vaccinations before visiting the Amazonian region you will probably be better off not taking any of them. There has not been a single case of ‘Yellow fever’ in the Iquitos region for over 15 years and you are not obliged to be vaccinated against it before visiting the area (despite what most Western doctors will tell you).

&gt; Hepatitis A and Typhoid are a very small risk but only from contaminated water supplies in urban areas. (9 years in Peru and I have never seen anyone get sick with either of these).

1669,"1 year, 6 months ago I partook in an ayahuasca ceremony. The experience itself was incredibly frightening and I came out of the ceremony completely traumatized by the trip and ended up having to take antipsychotics just to be able to function. As soon as  I try to wean off the medicament, all of my symptoms return. It's not been a kind healing 1.5 years :(

I work with multiple psychiatrist/ psychotherapists/ healers who have agreed that this is a very strong trauma reaction. And I have developed a severe form of ptsd with questionable psychotic feautures (I was still having hallucinations 10 months after ceremony, until they put me on an antipsychotic).  My anxiety is dehabilitating at times and there is a lingering fear that doesn't leave. I often worry if I'm ever gonna be able to come out of this hell. 

I worry that with ayahuasca becoming so popular, more people might end up with problems post ceremony. In my opinion, this plant isn't a one size fits all,  and one man's medicine can be another's poison.
I have seen countless shamans, energy healers, psychotherapists, craniosacral therapy, homeopathy, Neurofeedback, EMDR, somatic experiencing, the list goes on and on..
So far what's pulled me through is the antipsychotic. Without it, I'm completely unstable.

1677,"I’m leaving Peru today after 3 nights of ayahuasca ceremonies and thought I’d share my experience as it was truly something out of this world (as you already know).

For a bit of context, I’m 25, from Australia and decided to have ayahuasca primarily because this year I had changed quite dramatically mentally. I’m a social guy, have quite a few friends and always see myself as positive and optimistic in life. That changed this year with a terribly stressful job that consumed me and made me into a cynical, depressed and antisocial person who I could barely recognise. So I thought I’d come to Peru and see if this healing really works. Now for the 3 nights... Each was something so far removed from the last—none were the same.

Night 1.
Basically had no visuals. This night was completely introspective and all the relationships with my friends and family were laid out to me one by one throughout the night. With each, i was shown each interaction I’ve had with them all completely separated into layers, each one telling me how I misjudged their motives. Where I thought at times someone was didn’t like me or was just being rude, somehow it made me see that it wasn’t the case at all, but the complete opposite and they behaved the way they behaved because they did care about me and were being careful or sensitive but I was being too presumptive and blind to it. So by the end of the night, I had an overwhelming sense of love, admiration and even sorrow for misunderstanding them and I felt like a giant weight had been lifted off my shoulders. It was just brilliant and I’m excited to see them again when I get home and apologise for being an ass sometimes.

Night 2.
This was the real fun night. I went into real DMT land with the most beautiful visuals you could ever imagine. At one point in the night, I felt like I was a single blade of grass in the most beautiful field just enjoying the gorgeous landscape. When the peak started to wear off, its as though Mother Nature (Pachamama as the Peruvians say) told me no matter what happens in the world, everything will always be alright in the end. All the pain and suffering in the world is not as bad as we make it out to be and that these things are self-made ideas, as selfish as that sounds, but the synchronicity of every single minuscule being on earth plays its part in complete harmony for the world to go around and to just “be” in the universe. I know I sound like a nutter to most, but that’s what I got.

Night 3.
This one was the most unreal. It was like the final stage—the conclusion to myself and there was nowhere further to go. Basically, I was propelled beyond this world and into the galaxy. I was simply a rock... Floating in space, observing the stunning Milky Way. I don’t know if it symbolised anything because I didn’t take much from it, but I remember my mind not working the way it normally works. We think in words and during my trip, the words in my mind were scrambled. They didn’t exist in space and my mind was on a different frequency. The next day my shaman told me that when you go to space, it means you are exceptionally open-minded and nothing can bother you any more in the world. And I believe him. I feel as though I see things differently to most people. Maybe. I dunno. But it was just a crazy, wonderful and spectacular experience that I’m so thankful for.

They call ayahuasca a healing medicine and I genuinely believe I have been healed. I have a new outlook on life. I’m starting a new job when I get home and can’t wait to hug my friends and family so much. I would recommend anyone to try it and see what this medicine teaches you.",Ayahuasca,Ayahuasca truly changed my life.

1690,"For the last years I had a crazy interest in psychedelics. This was because my first trips were so transforming and showed me so much what I saw as truth. I never became so aware of ego and being authentic, the 'system' of the world which so many people follow without raising questions and a deep respect for nature and the planet. These truths and others hit hard and fast, which brought me out of balance.

I kept looking for more answers and experiences. But since I was out of balance I had some trips which were horrible and gave me other feelings that scared me.

Some parts of my body does not feel as they belong to me. I get very existential some times about the system of the world and this gives me a yarning hole in my chest which is unbearable and makes me feel suicidal at times. These are only a few fears of mine and there are more Shortly said, I finally realized it really did me more bad than good.

I know some people might think 'whatever it gave me is inside of me'. Please don't say this. Yes in a way that is true but not all what you see in a trip is true. I also thought this which also kept my fears alive. It was really hard for me to see it did me more bad than good because I was obsessed with 'knowing' more and I always held on to this first trip.

Maybe for some people this never happens and they are less easy to trick than me.

I hope the fears and the weird thoughts like 'my breasts don't belong to me', will fade in time so I can enjoy life more again. I will just keep busy in this world, hoping to appreciate it again.

1693,"This is a GHB/GBL analogue I have come into contact with recently, as a derivative of gabapentin; as I (incorrectly) like to call it, beta cyclohexyl GHB.

From what I understand, the cyclohexane ring gives the molecule greater lipophilic activity which is why gabapentin works as a medication as opposed to xenobiotic GABA as it is unable to pass the blood-brain barrier. Of course, GBL and GHB are able to do so since they exert a psychological (read therapeutic or recreational) effect; both these ~~and gabapentin~~* are able to agonise GABA-B receptor whereas only the former have activity at the excitatory GHB receptors.

*after doing some further reading, I discovered that gabapentin does not actually agonise GABA-B receptors; I was assuming that since it has similar structure to baclofen and phenibut it would produce a similar effect, yet this isn’t the case. Gabapentin acts as a ligand for regions on voltage-gated calcium channels instead, where it exerts its biological effects. Damn, I’m really not qualified to even understand this in depth.

Since there seems to be little information online, I was wondering if anyone could provide some pharmacological insight into this relatively unheard of compound. Would the cyclohexane ring theoretically inhibit activity at the GHB receptor and bolster GABA-B agonism? Apparently the related compound, 1-oxaspiro isomer, from what I have read, can produce ‘convulsions or effects on seizure threshold’ through IV administration to rats at doses of 90mg/kg, which would imply that it may have activity at the GHB receptor since these are excitatory phenomena. That, or I’m talking out of my arse and it’s another mechanism - http://www.thegoodscentscompany.com/data/rw1537601.html

Any information would be appreciated, as someone who is interested in the activity of GABAergic compounds, this compound has really piqued the scientific side of my mind! Here’s an image of both forms I came up with, due to the hydroxyacid-lactone equilibrium in solution:

1696,"I took ayahuasca 6 weeks ago and it was the most frightening, horrifying and real experience of my life.  I don't think I was ready for it but was convinced to try it by my girlfriend who thought it would help our relationship.
I'm in my mid thirties and I had taken antidepressants for half of my life.  For the last two years I had been on a very small dose and 2 months prior to the ceremony I stopped without much trouble.
During the ceremony I came to the realization that the whole way that I thought about life was a lie, and even I myself was a lie.  I was caught up in the illusion that through hard work and sacrifice I can achieve some sort of peace and happiness.  I realized I am going to die in such a tangible way, and something in me fought against this with all of my being.  I fought and fought against my impending death and even though I realized I could never win, I fought anyway.  I also felt more alone than I ever have in my life.
Then I started hearing the puking in the room.  It terrified me.  I saw human life as a serpentine form that had evolved from our digestive tracks.  We had evolve to serve the 'worms'.  Somehow they had learned how to bring my divine light into this god awful trap.  Free will was gone, only the imperative to serve and be used.  I felt like somehow this was part of the play between masucline and feminine.  The feminine existed only to serve herself.  Love, kindess, compassion, everything was an illusion just to get us to feed these damn things.

I saw how my parents and a lot of society lives for the 'dream of tomorrow'.  How we just can't let this dream die in the medical field and have so little respect for the changes that are inevitable in life as we age.  I saw that somehow I had to let go of this 'dream of tomorrow', but it was too painful to bear.  I saw how so many people in history had flocked to big cities in the hopes of prosperity only to find their dreams to be hollow.

I felt utterly trapped in a web of lies of my own creation and it was terrifying.  I was entrapped in a system that enriches the few at the cost of the many.  And I was responsible for it all.

I felt I was in the presence of something very dark.  I don't really believe in concepts like good and evil in real life (I take a taoist kind of approach), but this felt unmistakably evil.  I saw the light in me, something good, striving, creative and hopeful.  And I saw it being tortured by this darkness.  As I was crying out in despair and agony I could vividly sense how this entity/energy was gaining some sort of sadistic pleasure from my suffering.  It literally felt like my soul was being raped.

I also realized I had to morn the loss of my girlfriend.  I saw that we were each on an island, and as the icaros was being sung hauntingly in the background I experienced such a painful sense of abandonment and lonliness as I realized we are fundamentally alone, we die alone and we will always be alone.

I will say that I was a bit sick with a fever when I took the ayahuasca.  Everyone told me said it would be okay, but I wonder if that was a contributing factor.  I was very sick emotionally and physically for the next few weeks.  I wasn't eating and I felt numb like I had been through a very traumatic experience.  After two weeks I took a small dose of antidepressants and that has been helping a little bit, but I still wake up every morning with intense fear.

Even today I have flashbacks frequently about the fact that I am going to get sick and old and die.  I see a terrified old woman, a smoker, coughing and dying with emphysema as the representation of the universe trying to understand itself and create something beautiful but failing. 

I am hoping some day I am able to see the value in what I experienced, but my life recently seems consumed with fear.  Ayahuasca showed more truth than I was ready to see. I can't see myself continuing in my career in my current state.  I know ayahuasca has helped many people, but I also wonder how many it has hurt?  In a sense I supposed all it has hurt is my mind/ego/sense of self, but going from a successful professional to a crippled mass of fear feels like a step back for both my soul/society/and the universe.   I am finding some help through acupuncture, mindfulness based body centered therapy and meditation, but I am having a very difficult time feeling like I'm safe in my body.  I'm curious if people have been through similar experiences and have managed to live happy lives?  I'm hoping this is all part of my healing journey and turns out to be something good.  If anyone has any advice for how to move forward I'm very open to it. 

*** UPDATE 7-9-2018 ****
Its been about six weeks since I first posted this and wanted to share an update.  I'm doing a lot better and I'm starting to integrate these experiences.  I've been getting acupuncture several times a week and this has helped me a lot.  I'm also seeing a therapist that has had some experience with ayhuasca.  I am taking a very small dose of an antipsychotic medicine called aripiprazole.  The normal dose for schizophrenia is 10-30mg, the usual dose for depression is 2mg and I am taking 0.1mg.  Its possible that it is mostly a placebo affect at this dose but I'm hesitant to change it because I am doing well now.  It doesn't interfere at all with my ability to think.  I still have occasional days where there is some fear but for the most part I am getting better.  I spend a lot of my time out in nature which I think has been healing as well.  I'm still trying to decide whether to return to my stressful career or do something new (although I am running out of time).  Things are looking bright and there is hope in my life again.  I can see a lot of the experiences on ayahuasca were things I needed to see but that I was just unwilling to see. 

I realize I'm very fortunate to have the resources to take time off of work and find healing.  There are many who are traumatized and left without the support to find their way back to themselves.  My heart goes out to these lost souls and I hope that one day I may be able to help others who are struggling with processing these difficult revelations.

I'm a general practitioner who now has some patients that have ME/CFS.  I have read up on some of the research but I do feel that this is a little out of reach of my training, yet the referrals to specialists haven't yielded much so far, so I feel a responsibility to look into this and be able to offer these patients some treatment.

&amp;#x200B;

It seems like there have been very few successful drug trials in ME/CFS, partially due to lack of funding, but that there has started to be a decent amount of research more in the data gathering stage than hypothesis-testing, and that some of this research is high quality and is painting a general picture of what is wrong, with a couple areas that suggest some drug targets.

&amp;#x200B;

Specifically, I've read a few studies on CFS that indicate impaired metabolism.

[http://www.pnas.org/content/113/37/E5472](http://www.pnas.org/content/113/37/E5472) This one by Robert Naviaux is interesting.  It does not suggest drug targets but indicates an analogy to a hypometabolic state in worms called ""dauer"".  It suggests that supplement interventions aimed at glycine, serine, and B6 stores could be helpful.

&amp;#x200B;

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5161229/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5161229/)

&amp;#x200B;

This one is a little more limited and specifically focuses on impaired pyruvate dehydrogenase function in CFS. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I have found a little about drugs that could help pyruvate dehydrogenase function.  I'm guessing that it's not totally blocked, obviously the patients can still utilize glucose and aren't dying of acidosis like people with Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Complex Deficiency.   Obviously the problem with metabolism could go way beyond pyruvate dehydrogenase but this seems like an appropriate thing to target, at least to start with.  So I guess I'm looking for PDK inhibitors and/or anything that helps shift the balance of of pyruvate/lactate--the redox balance.  

&amp;#x200B;

DCA looks promising but also maybe toxic.  High dose thiamine and sodium phenylbutyrate seem possibly helpful, and are also used in Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Complex Deficiency.

Morning after UPDATE :
Why the hostility and narrow-minded thoughts?
I did it. I've felt way higher from other things.
Today I am going to hangout with friends and family.
I actually feel refreshed and ""reset"".
Since this is a subreddit for the science behind drugs, I want to explain how this was a little experiment of mine.
I wanted to test how heroin addiction works.
First-hand. I want to know. That's how I operate.

Here's what I've learned :

1. Heroin is way over-demonized (but I also understand that this harmless face is what makes it potentially dangerous to new users)
It was a typical opiate feeling.
I've always preferred to be active and stimulated, but I view all drugs as tools to modify the human mental/physical/spiritual state as we deem necessary.

2. It is apparent to me now that my theory that ""It's not the drugs that make people slaves, it's the individual users life scenario and characteristics that make them more or less prone to addiction/habituation."" Also applies to Heroin.
That was the true reason for me trying it.
There's an excellent short video about this on YT https://youtu.be/ao8L-0nSYzg

If you all want to be a part of an science-based subreddit then I suggest you stop immediately assuming that everyone who tries a certain substance is automatically going to be addicted. 
Take a step back and focus on the real issue.
It's not the substance.
It's why someone would want to abuse a substance and ruin their lives just to feel normal for a while.
Heroin is basically just Super-Morphine.
Strong/er opiates have been administered to many people in hospitals, for chronic pain relief, etc.
A percentage of those people become dependent, a percentage don't.
I think we should be looking into the psychology of addiction because the modern approach of only looking at the pharmacology is sadly incomplete.

TL;DR 
Yeah I smoked it.
It was nice.
I've been exponentially higher many times before.
I have never been a habitual user of opiates, they're not my true Drugs of Choice.
Psychedelics, stimulants, herb, and Kratom all the way baby.
Actually I smoked some fire cannabis the other night and actually felt better!!
I remember reading about Opiate deaths dropping in states with decriminalized cannabis. I totally understand why.

It was a relaxing break from my over-active mind.
I don't plan on seeking it out or using it again.
The sun is out and my friends and I are going to take some MDMA and camp.
Enjoy your day :)

Update...10-23
I've been fucking fantastic. Better than ever.
Quit all hard drugs. Not even craving them.
I'm addicted to exercise and recreational sports now!
Getting my life even more on track.
And not only in the way that society wants me to, but I mean I am pursuing my own passions.
Hitting the gym daily, staying active and on-top of everything.
Balancing my hormones and moods with diet/exercise/sleep.
I find the flood of immaturity here disgraceful to the purpose of this board.
Just because someone does hard drugs does not mean they are destined for addiction.
It is far more complex than that so ditch that notion...
Living proof right here.

Now let me add this...
I should note that I am blessed with loving family and friends who support me, a home, a van, a good job, access to modern luxuries like a local YMCA and food/clothes on demand.
Basically I'm saying that I have far better and more reliable sources of joy than Heroin or anyother drug for that matter.
Others are not so blessed.
I can clearly see how someone less-fortunate could be dependent on Heroin (or any drug) for joy because the rest of their life is lacking.
I am not making an excuse for playing the victim-role, I am just saying I understand.
If you are addicted to hard drugs, just remember that you can get the same feelings, often even better and more reliable, from other natural sources.
Please seek help and be vulnerable about what you really want from life, instead of numbing your inner-pains with temporary artificial feel-good chemicals.

My great fears which lie below the surface, bubble up and become my very own hell, no more hiding, no more buffering, no escape, just me and the existential terror that haunts me.

I'm not sure if I could handle it -- I've read about it a lot, but Christ I don't know if I'd really be a good candidate for it! Or ready for it.

I have reached a point where I believe I can never integrate into conventional BPME societies and also don't wish to. I wish to commune with the part of myself, full of unresolved traumas, which hold deep rooted self doubt/self hatred it seems, and blocks me from experiencing the life I want: living simply by the decrees of self nurturance; cocreating meaningful experiences with fellow people; easing the suffering of all lifeforms through eternal studenthood and refusing to participate in a corrupt system (to the greatest degree possible, successionally); refusing to propagate ill paradigms of misunderstanding; carving experiences of peace and bliss by listening to the land, healing the land, and living on what the land offers back in return. 

I have heard people describe ayahuasca journeys as being an intensely physical experience, where curandera and assistant's presence is necessary in case of medical emergency (as opposed to ritual facilitating community bonding as with peyote, for example). I have heard that ayahuasca is intended to bring you close to the point of physical death, as apart of her function as a cleansing tool of rebirth, similar to iboga (which I also have not experienced and speak of based only on reading others' accounts).

What do you feel the relationship is between physical infirmity and ayahuasca? If I do not wish to risk death, might I earn her mentorship by first committing to regaining soundness of body?

1741,"Hello, fellow Reddit users. I pose a question to you all. I have been thinking about a possible way to make a salvia nasal spray. However, there isn't much in terms of its solubility in various liquids that would be safe for intranasal use. I was thinking of a 10% DMSO solution to reach my desired 1mg/ml potency. But I have seen very mixed views on DMSO being used by humans. As far as I  know, 5% DMSO has been tested as safe, but the solubility of salvinorin a is said to be greater than or equal to 10mg/ml in DMSO. Assuming the worst, and it was 10mg/ml, that 5% mixture wouldn't work for what I would like to do. So I was wondering if any of you know of any (safe for intranasal use) liquids that salvinorin a is soluble in. Preferably I would like to have the solubility to be anywhere from 5mg/ml to 20mg/ml at around 25c so that when the temp goes down, it doesn't become less soluble and crash out. So to add some backstory to this so you guys can try to figure it out if you wish, my plan is to put it into a nasal spray bottle that doses .1ml per spray. This comes out to 100 micrograms per spray. I think that should be a decent dose per spray since a starter dose is roundabout 200 micrograms. I was going to either buy pure extract and make it in bulk or let the leaves sit in the liquid to absorb it. I think the safest method would be to buy pure salvinorin a and make it my the 100ml or so. Anyways let me know what you guys know. I'll still be researching.

&amp;#x200B;

Update: Found out that salvinorin a is a hydrophobic diterpene. Other common hydrophobic diterpenes are phyto-cannabinoids. This may be as simple as extracting it with acetone or ethanol and adding that to some glycerine, PG or VG and letting the original solvent evaporate. Someone also mentioned salvia tabs. First I gotta say that's an amazing idea. In theory, you would only have to extract it with an evaporating solvent, spray or soak your sheet, and let it evaporate. This isn't something I've ever thought about but it is definitely a possibility that I will have to try out in the near future. Hopefully, next update will be ordering some pure salvinorin a to test with.

&amp;#x200B;

Update 2: Since this is the same class as cannabinoids, I could, theoretically, make this into a **tincture** or nasal spray using MCT coconut oil, into a **vape juice** with PG&amp;VG, or into **edibles** with butter or something similar. I got into this thinking this would take a while to get solved and/or not work. But this can potentially open up a new world of safe, controlled doses of Salvia Divinorum. Time to start a business?

&amp;#x200B;

Update 3: I have ordered everything necessary to start the extraction of pure salvinorin a. The salvia will be the longest to show up so I'm just waiting on that. Found a pretty good deal on 120g of salvia (normal potency) dried and crushed leaves for $65. This should theoretically give me 300mg if I make a 100% efficient extraction. I'll be happy if I even get 100 out of it. Realistically I'll probably get close to 250 if I want to make it as pure as possible.

&amp;#x200B;

Update 3: I have tested the CBD nasal spray and it works flawlessly. It absorbed into the MCT oil quickly and without hassle. This is giving me high hopes for the salvinorin a. I also found a lab procedure outlining how to make the inclusion complex needed to make it bioavailable in the mouth and nostrils. This is a huge step forward in the process. Since I found such a good deal on salvia leaves, I will be able to do many trials and find out what works best.",DrugNerds,Salvinorin A Nasal Spray

I'd like to know if people who became delusional and psychotic after taking mushrooms in a bad set and setting could heal it through a good shaman in an Ayahuasca Retreat?

I asked around alot and some say it can become worse and others say it can be healed.
It's actually about my brother who already had a pretty sad, lonely and traumatic life and took anti psychotics without actually needing them through some very bad health""professionals"" through which he experienced years of psychiatric abuse and violence.
But recently he took a high dose of mushrooms that I had bred at home thinking they could make him feel good as they did to me and gradually he became very delusional and paranoid up to the point of thinking that alot of people are waiting around the corner on the street to kill him and that we (his family got murdered) and we are the murderers In disguise that he needs to live with now.

1766,"An excerpt from Zhuan Falun (from Talk 2 - The Third Eye):

""So Daoists consider the human body a small universe, and that makes a lot of sense. They’re not saying that its compositional structure is like the universe’s, they’re not talking about the form our body takes in this material dimension. We want to ask this: what’s the material body’s state below the level of cells as today’s science understands it? There are all kinds of molecular particles, and below molecules there are atoms, protons, nuclei, electrons, quarks, and the smallest microscopic particle that’s been researched so far is the neutrino.

So what’s the absolute smallest microscopic particle? It’s just too hard to research. In his later years Shakyamuni said, ""It is so large that it has no exterior, and so small that it has no interior."" And what’s that mean? It means that at the Tathagata level, in terms of largeness, you can’t see the edge of the universe, and in terms of smallness, you can’t see the smallest microscopic particle of matter. That’s why he said, ""It is so large that it has no exterior, and so small that it has no interior.""

Shakyamuni also put forth the theory of 3,000 boundless universes. He said that in the Milky Way galaxy of our universe there are 3,000 planets that have beings with carnal bodies on them, just like the human race. He also said that a grain of sand has 3,000 boundless universes like this one in it, so a grain of sand is like a universe, with intelligent human beings like us in it, and there are planets like this one, and mountains and rivers.

Sounds hard to believe, right?! If it’s true, then let’s think, isn’t there sand in those universes? And in each of those grains of sand, aren’t there 3,000 boundless universes there, too? Then isn’t there sand in those 3,000 boundless universes? And in each of those grains of sand, aren’t there again 3,000 boundless universes? So at the Tathagata level you can’t see the end of it all.

The same goes for human molecular cells. People wonder how large the universe is. I can tell you that this universe does have boundaries, but even at the Tathagata level it still seems like it’s boundless and infinite. But the inside of the human body, going from its molecules down to its microscopic particles in the microcosm, it’s as large as this universe. I know it sounds hard to believe. In the extreme microcosm of what makes up a human being, or any being, his nature and the unique elements of his being have been formed.

So our modern science’s research on this is still miles away. The level of our human race’s science and technology is pretty low when you compare it to that of the beings of higher wisdom on other planets in the greater universe. We don’t even have the ability to break through dimensions that exist at the same time and in the same place, while the flying saucers from other planets can just go and travel in other dimensions, even the concept of space-time changes, so they come and go in the blink of an eye, and it’s so fast nobody can explain it.""

1767,"I'm a 25 yo guy from Lima, Perú and I'm in between jobs so I figured I could travel somewhere this week before starting my new job on monday. I decided to go to Puerto Maldonado, Madre de Dios, Perú. I didn't really planned anything but while I was there visiting the Tambopata Reserve, I was told there was going to be an Ayahuasca ceremony that night. I've experienced LSD, shrooms and weed so I decided to go for it.

The ceremony took place in a big, beautiful dome in the middle of the jungle at night. There, I met a group of friends that went together: a guy from LA, a brother and sister from San Francisco with peruvian parents, and a girl from Lima. I really liked them so I was confortable and even gratefull to share this experience with them. 

Jonathan, the shaman, started drinking something and smoking tobacco. He gave us 2 shots of ayahuhasca, and made us smoke a little too. I really didn't know what to expect, I knew it might made me puke but I really dont like puking so I would avoid that if possible. I've been reading about mindfulness and so  when I took it, I layed down and started concentrating on my breathing and trying to relax and keep my mind quiet. I really just wanted the ayahuasca to do it's thing.  

I felt a light above my head that went through me, and I felt a vibration or frecuency that went higher and higher. I felt loved. I realised all the love that's in my life, in my family and in my social circle. I was crying all night because of this realisation, It was so much love! I realised everything I am, everything I have, and every \(good\) thing happening to me \(new job, for example\) was a product of love. I didn't really hallucinate or ""talked"" with another entity tho.

At 3am, the shaman told us it was time to go back to our rooms. I stood up and felt super dizzy. I haven't puked or shited until that moment, whereas everyone else but LA guy did. As soon as I walked out of the dome, LA guy \(didn't get his name :\( \) and I, puked almost at the same time. Puking me feel less sick, but also made me have some crazy visuals for a little while and I couldn't really control my legs \- so I don't know how I continued walking. When I got to my room, I stayed in the bathroom for an hour before my tour guide knoked on my door and told me to take a bath and meet him by the river, It was time for my next adventure in Tambopata.

Has anyone had a similar experience? I'm not sure if maybe been so relaxed that I didn't puke made me not hallucinate? did I miss something by not hallucinating? do you guys think I didn't get the full experience Ayahuasca has to offer?

1769,"Greetings from Peru! I’m 2 days out from a 30 day stay near Yarinacocha and the Ucayali river. I just had an interesting conversation with a Peruvian friend and wanted to share with this community, to paint a bigger picture of who the shaman are and their concerns. Keep in mind I’m an American and this is all from my western view and interpretation. 

As you may know, the shaman are workers of magic. The way I see it is they are able to manipulate the energetic fabric that stretches over the universe and connects us and everything together. I choose this description because it seems to fit and it is a **neutral** medium. This is important because it allows for a broad spectrum of magics and intended purposes. 

The shaman are just regular people like you and me. They have families, traumatic live events, ambitions, battled with addictions et cetera. They have a profession just like we do. Now, I’m saying this because I want to remind you not to put these people on a pedestal. We can get caught up in the mysticism as westerners - don’t. 

Just like with people you meet in your regular life, these shaman have their own needs and desires. Simply put, there are good and bad shaman. This is why you hear so many different experiences and stories about ayahuasca because we’re exposed to all these shaman. 

A good shaman, like any good person, wants to help, heal, and build as much as they can. They thrive off these joys in life. They work with ayahuasca or other medicines with the intention of protecting and healing others. 

A dark shaman is someone who desires power. They are people who have personal and spiritual wounds that they have not healed themselves of. Like others who operate on a low spiritual level, they are controlled by feelings like greed and jealousy. This is the psychology of the trickster and deceiver.

Browse through the countless stories of terrifying experiences. People wander into the traps of these dark shaman, and like a fly caught in the spiders web they are helpless to their will. In extreme cases people are killed and women are raped. What I can guarantee happens is your energy is fed upon. You are used to bring power and energy to the shaman. People report feeling paralyzed and horrified. They see brooding darkness and miasma, and frightening shapeshifting from the shaman. They walk away scarred trying to piece together what exactly happened. 

What these shaman do with this this energy I’m not entirely educated on but I do know they attack other shaman. Here’s where my friend’s story comes in. I’ll sum it up. 

A well-known shaman who is family of my shamans has gained popularity. He makes a lot of money with his work. Recently he was attacked, energetically, by multiple shaman. During a ceremony he was able to perceive this. His ceremony started and as he went to sing he was stabbed energetically and screamed out in pain. He was able to protect himself and his group but the energy wasn’t repelled and found its way to a new target - his daughter. Shortly after she became deathly ill and died within weeks. The doctors found she had died from meningeal tuberculosis. She was a healthy mother. 

Another story. There was a guy with mental illness who was going from shaman to shaman begging to be cured. Each shaman said they could cure him but they didn’t. He ended up with some bad shaman. He ended up paying this guy a lot of money. Tens of thousands. The shaman worked on him in a bad way. Later than year the man went into the town near where I am going. He went to the house of a well known shaman and murdered her. My friend said he was twisted and went mad after working with this bad shaman.

1772,"Hi, 

I’ve recently been researching into ayahuasca and am considering going to a retreat to take part in ayahuasca ceremonies. I have fibromyalgia (apparently, but that’s a whole ‘nother story 🙈) which in turn has made my depression horrendous. I’ve read that it can help depression and fibromyalgia but I’d love to hear directly from people with chronic pain/depression, their stories if you wouldn’t mind sharing? Did it help? How many ceremonies did it take to help? What was your experience like? Thanks in advance for anyone who takes the time to speak to me. ❤️❤️❤️",Ayahuasca,Wondering if anyone who has Fibromyalgia/chronic pain has experienced ayahuasca?? 😃
1773,"Just some fun ideas to entertain here. 

I was watching this show *Mars* on the National Geographic channel, it's sort of half drama half documentary about how we might potentially start a permanent outpost on Mars within the not-too-distant future. 

They brought up experiments NASA has done simulating what it would be like for a small crew to spend well over a year in a confined spacecraft on the way to Mars, dealing with claustrophobia, cabin fever, stress and other psychological issues, and of course upon arriving at Mars, they would not be leaving anytime soon and would be pretty much isolated and left to fend for themselves against the elements there (on Mars both the temperature and atmospheric pressure are pretty much always trying to kill you it would seem). 

They locked test subjects up like this for the length of time required in order to study the psychological effects, they said that out of 6 subjects, 4 showed signs of serious issues by the end of the experiment. That doesn't bode well. 

So anyway, with that in mind, it occurred to me that it might make sense if one were to put the crew into a sort of ""semi-hibernation"" in order to reduce the perceived time spent travelling and hopefully improve psychological health in the process. You might use medications to induce sleep  for 16 hours a day or more, or at least 12 at the least. 

Of course I do wonder if it would be feasible to keep someone unconscious for almost the *entire trip* or if that would be too much to shoot for. 

You could conceivably do this with something like remeron perhaps, which is a very powerful long acting hypnotic that is nonaddictive, or perhaps with an antipsychotic, or rotating thru several different varieties of hypnotics to prevent tolerance to any one occurring.  

It would be interesting to see what's the max amount of sleep per day you can induce without causing too much negative effects. I take remeron myself and just half of a 15mg tab, the lowest dose they make, will make you sleep for 12-14 hours easy without a tolerance. I wonder if you could sleep as long as 24 hours without really stopping. I tend to find that after a point it becomes difficult to continue sleeping when you push the duration like that. 

Anyway I'm curious what your thoughts are on this. Would hibernation during long periods of space travel work out as it does in SF films? Or would there be unacceptable consequences? How could it be done effectively? 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I wonder how muscle atrophy would be affected. Already you will lose serious bone and muscle spending that much time in space even if you are exercising, it's worrisome to think how being in hibernation could compound that issue. Also, gravity on Mars is only 38% of earth's, so it's gonna be an ongoing issue. Though it's worth wondering whether you can make up for this simply by carrying extra weight on your person while on Mars, essentially making the load on your legs and frame closer to what it would be on earth and hopefully preserving your strength. 

Another idea, conceivably you could install a PICC line on each astronaut to allow easy IV access for hypnotics and perhaps partial parenteral nutrition as well, maybe with a catheter to collect urine as well. This would cut down on the amount of waking up you would have to do, allowing you to sleep much longer at a time. 

It would seem that chronobiology is also an essential aspect of understanding the mental issues that can arise during such a trip. Your biological rhythms are likely to be severely disturbed, hibernation or not. You would likely get the phenomenon know as ""free running"" sleep where you cease to sleep on a timely schedule based on the 24 hour day we evolved to deal with. Your sleeping patterns become erratic and the lack of synchronization of the body's internal clocks (of which the master piece is the superchiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus, aka the SCN) could lead to all kinds of hormone imbalances complicating things further. 

Perhaps you could help this by using a strict period of light and dark with those special lamps they give to people with seasonal affective disorder to imitate sunlight.  If you aren't aware, your SCN resets itself each morning when blue light from the sky hits your retinas as you wake up; some of the nerves in the eye travel directly to the SCN and cause a signal cascade to synchronize the chemical process by which the SCN keeps time, which involves a negative feedback loop of two sets of proteins stimulating, and then inhibiting the production of the other set, in an endless cycle. There's a nifty animation explaining that here: 2e.mindsmachine.com/av10.04.html",DrugNerds,Artificially inducing hibernation/sleep in humans for long periods for the purpose of interplanetary travel.

Hes a kind person who isnt really into the consciousness stuff  but I know he needs healing.. hes a loving guy that keeps emotions bottled up.. I'm planning on going down south to have my first ceremony this October and I want to bring him after he does an alcohol detox. Hes quit many times on his own before.. I should add he only drinks at night maybe from 6 until he falls asleep about 5 beers or more.

I used mushrooms and DMT to break my addiction to opiates and I just want my father to be liberated as well.

1777,"Alright, so basically I left my Hotel at around 19:50, the ceremony being at 20. The place of the ceremony was really close by, 5min walking from Hotel, the entrance was at a quiet residential apartment block's inner yard, where a small building stood. Positive looking Dutch guy walks up to me and says, ""Hi, are you x,"" I say yeah, we talk some pleasantries and exchange a handshake. He says almost everyone has already arrived, and how it's strange everyone is already here, because people tend to come late normally, and they are only waiting for 1 woman anymore. I go inside, they offer me tea and tell me to sit somewhere. There is 10 other people around me, kinda young, 18-30 looking, half women, half men sitting in a circle. There is 3 instructors, the man, another man and a woman. I take some tea and sit on the floor, and in no time, the last person arrives too. We are told we'll do some group yoga and meditation. A bit of mixed techniques, like Kundalini Yoga and Zazen meditation, through everything from breathing, chakra points, stillness of mind. This lasted about 30-60 minutes. The atmosphere was mostly calm and peaceful. After The Yoga and meditation, mattresses were spread across the hall in a circle, and we were told to pick one. I picked one in the corner furthest from the entrance. In the middle they set up a circle from candles, one candle for each of us, we were told to lit one candle each in turn. Some time passed, one of the other instructors, a Mexican guy, a Shaman who studied in North America with Ayahuasca Gurus, comes to us and tells us to stand up one by one, he wraps some tobacco in a leaf, and lights it. In North-American belief, Tobacco smoke, in addition to being smoked to achieve shamanic states, is used to ward off evil spirits. So one by one, as we stand, he goes around us, with another leaf he blows the smoke all around us individually, while singing a traditional North-American song called Icaro, which is often associated with the Ceremony. You can search one on Youtube, to hear what it's like, if you're interested. After he is done cleaning all of us, including the instructors, he cleans the entire space with the smoke. The Dutch guy then thanks him and brings the Ayahuasca, separated into two bowls. He explains that in one bowl is a thing called Harmala, a plant which contains something called MAOi, Mono Amine Oxydizine-inhibitor. It is probably non-psychoactive, but basically creates a layer in your stomach, which prevents the next chemical, DMT, from being destroyed once it goes there, and allows DMT to be absorbed into your blood-stream, as DMT would normally be destroyed if you ingested it orally. In the next bowl is a thing called DMT, Di Methyl Tryptamine, the psycho-active compound that causes the changes in brain that bring about the psychedelic experience. He gives the rap about how it was discovered (plants told the shamans) and how it is found on pretty much anything alive, including the grass outside your window, and in your pineal gland. He says we'll take the Harmala first, then wait 15 minutes, and take the DMT. Each time they give you one of them, they also offer a small snack and a pastille because the liquids taste obnoxious. I personally found the pastille to be more obnoxious than the liquid itself, so I declined to take anything, when offered, after the initial offering. They go around, one by one, and give us first the Harmala, then the DMT, they also give us vomit buckets. I'm the second last one to get the portion. As they give the Harmala, they also ask us to pick a card from a makeshift ""tarot"" deck and think of it's meaning. As they give the DMT, they ask us to say something in our minds to the Spirit of the Ayahuasca, which is seen as sort of a ""feminine motherly force,"" a deity of the earth, similar to Terra or the feminine side of the ""Anima Mundi."" I simply say, ""Hello, please take care of me."" I lay down on the mattress, some time passes but I have very little knowledge of it as there is no clocks anywhere. Once in a while, the shaman rings a bell. At some point I start feeling nauseous, and 15-30 minutes into it, I vomit. I am the first one to vomit, possibly because I ate nothing in the last two days except for a small bag of dried bananas to keep up with the jungle diet that is usually enforced with the use, as certain foods can affect the experience in certain ways, so to the get the purest experience, arguably you should have as little other chemicals in your system as possible, but guess I went a bit overboard. After vomiting two times, I fall back on the mattress. Not a single person vomits for another 15-30 minutes, but when the first of them does, soon they all do, one by one. I look at the ceiling and I start to see a bit visual distortions. Colors look weird and so do shapes. The nausea slowly disappears and I kinda feel light, relaxed and good. I close my eyes and start to feel things, then I start to see things. At first I begin to manifest all the darkest things, but immediately it pretty much tells me that it is me doing that, and that for once, I should surrender myself to imagine and see things that are not coming from my ego, and all the dark things disappear in a flash. I then surrender to this intelligence, or is it an intelligence or some deep locked down part of my subconsciousness that I never use? Who knows, either way, I stat to see a picture of life and the universe, reality itself, from a perspective I'm not used to. It is something akin to lucid dreaming, except you are so awake and conscious that this is happening, and there is always a presence of something intelligent with you, as in the things that you perceive, are not originating just from you, but from it as well. So I see this picture of the world for a while, like the entirety of existence as a painting, but then I start to hear noises. I open my eyes, and look around in the dimly lit room, a person near me is laughing uncontrollably, and his laughter causes some other person to laugh in response, some people are talking to themselves, some are screaming, some crying, I silently look at all this unfold, think to myself ""what a mess,"" and nonchalantly fall back into the mattress, close my eyes and go back into my own thing. I experience and see countless things, knowledge is pouring into me and I feel good. I see some negative stuff, like an all seeing eye that I realize is everywhere and has been everywhere through my whole life. It will visit me again in a dream few weeks later, but that's another story. Visions of what will happen to earth and humanity, what will happen to me. Some positive stuff as well, such as instructions on what is wrong with me, how to improve my life, insight into how people perceive me, how I perceive myself. I also keep seeing things which I think are attempting to relay me an idea about the artificiality of reality. For example, I would see things that were impossible, like I mean truly impossible, like there is no way something like that could physically happen or exist in our reality due to limitations of not just physical laws, but dimensionality and linearity of time, like a person existing in 2 dimensions, seeing into 3 dimensions, yet, I saw it, and it just blew my mind. How can I perceive something with my 4 dimensional senses that breaks the conditions of those same 4 dimensions, do I exist outside time and space? Things like that. Every now and then I would be woken up by either the screams and noises of the other people in the room, the ringing bell, or the smell of the burning tobacco, which the shaman goes around blowing nd ringing while walking around the room at certain intervals, a purpose of which I think is to call us back into our bodies and remind me that we have bodies, because when you go into your mind in this state, I guess it's very easy to forget you even have a body, and if you go into a really dark place, you might need some help to get out, but that's just my guess. At one point I'm cold and I guess visibly shaking from it, as a woman comes and bring me another planket and puts it on me without asking. Every now and then I'm asked if I'm okay, I'm offered water, etc. I guess at around 4-6 hours into it, I'm asked if I want to take another dose of the ayahuasca, I say yes, and again the two bowls go in a circle and I'll take my portion in my turn while sitting on the mattress. There's one guy whose moved from his mattress, sitting near the candles, crying and seems to be writing something down. A girl next to me, who is also one of the quieter ones, also seems to be crying. I vomit and fall into my mind again. Things progress pretty much in the same manner as thus far. At some point I wake up to the shaman singing an Icaro, it is said if you look at an Icaro while on Ayahuasca, you can see the song take physical form, and if you sing yourself, your song will also take shape. But I'm not really interested, I feel my attention should be inwards and I go back into myself. Hours go by, eventually I come back to my body again for good this time, and start feeling more normal. Everyone has quieted down, most are sleeping. I'll fall asleep myself as well. In the morning my mind is completely empty, a lot of people are talking and discussing their experiences, my mind is really blank. Some come ask me too what I thought, but I just say I need to process it. The Dutch guy came, and we talked a bit, he remarked to all of us how the corner where I was at, had an energy of calmness and sense of humbleness. Apart from the guy on my left, the two people to my right, were like me, mostly quiet the whole time. He said that similar energies tend to go and  gather into similar spots in these ceremonies often. Talked some more, paid the thing, said goodbyes and went on my way. The state of mind I woke up in resisted for up to a week, I don't think my thoughts have ever been so at peace, and my mind so calm, like water on a pond on a windless day. I found myself almost unable to blink. I heard a constant humming in my ear, but it was not something that bothered me,  it was like I heard the hum of life, a vibration that always went on and on, upwards and upwards. But slowly, as weeks passed, I heard the hum less and less, I started to feel my ego take hold back. ",Ayahuasca,My experience

Secondly I wanted to know if the Xanax I take will interfere or lessen the trip.

But I was thinking I wouldn't take it on ceremony days and take them on the rest days. that way I can still have the experience without going through the withdrawals. At least that's my plan. If it doesn't sound like it will work let me know.

I Am The Medicine. I Am The Cure. A Very Detailed First-Timer's Tale of Empowerment

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Where does one begin to describe an experience that they asked others to describe hundreds of times but was constantly told they wouldn't understand?

&amp;#x200B;

Night One

&amp;#x200B;

I guess it begins on a beautiful farm on a mountain overlooking a lake, one cold evening in October. 25-30 People from all walks of life arrived to share in ceremony with each other. Pleasantries were exchanged, strangers and friends were introduced, backgrounds were shared, excitement and nervousness filled the atmosphere. 

&amp;#x200B;

I came into this ceremony with a lot of emotional trauma and dramatic life changing events I've endured in the last 18 months. I had expectations based off of things I had read about the experience, and knew I was going to go through some heavy stuff. I expected haunting visions of mistakes I'd made. I expected buried problems bubbling up to the surface. I expected pain and suffering and was ready to embrace it.

&amp;#x200B;

Most of us laid under the tent in our blankets and sleeping beds waiting for Taita Pedro. The talking and sharing of emotions with others had calmed me down. I felt prepared, I had let go of the fear. I was ready to proceed.

&amp;#x200B;

Around 11PM Taita Pedro entered the tent and the energy immediately changed. Was this the beginning? My heart rate accelerated, my hands started sweating. I started getting nervous. Was I ready? Was I afraid? I didn't have to contemplate long before Taita left the tent and I settled back down. You can do this, I kept telling myself. You are ready. I made a joke to my friend that Taita was already testing me, because he could feel that I came in wanting to work on my patience. He was testing my patence before even administering the test.

&amp;#x200B;

An hour later Taita came back in with a pitcher of a viscous liquid. This is it. This is real. The flood of fear came back. I'm not so sure anymore...

&amp;#x200B;

Taita then introduced himself. He explained his role as a shaman. He told us the history of his family and Columbian ancestors. He told us how 'la medicina' was used for thousands of years. How the Creator created animals and plants. And everything was in perfect synchronocity until the Creator added a third, conscience. This hurt the balance of the planet. Conscience took over, and caused all of the problems and ills in society. He explained his 'la medicina' took away your conscience. It showed you your more primitive nature, your original design. He warned that those who came for a 'psychedelic experience' wouldn't be given one. That the medicine doesn't give us what we want, but it gives us exactly what we need. He talked about how we all came together as strangers. And after tonight we would be friends. But after the weekend, we would all be 'la familia'. Everyone is 'la familia'.

&amp;#x200B;

Taita stood over the brew after opening the ceremony with his beautiful speech and blessed it with song. His voice permeated the tent and sent all of us into a pleasant calm lull. Silence, patience, surrender.

&amp;#x200B;

He called all celebrating their first ceremony up first. I got up and stood about 10th in line, still perfectly calm. His opening ceremony ringing in my head. I replayed my expectations in my mind. I was prepared to purge my demons. I was prepared to confront them head on, I was readying myself for battle with myself. As I watched the person in front of me have their drink blessed by Taita, the fear came over me again. I could barely stand. I felt dizzy, shaking, heart pounding out of my chest. The person in front of me drank their drink, and I kept wondering ""What if I throw it up? What if it's so gross I can't even drink it? What if I spit it up all over the place before I even get it down?""

&amp;#x200B;

Fear gripped me by the bones and controlled my final steps as I walked toward Taita when he summoned me for my turn. I stood in front of him staring him in the eyes, feeling his energy staring directly into my soul. As he blessed my cup we stared at each other, locked in each others gaze. My heart still pounding, he reached out to hand me the cup. As soon as my hands touched the cup, the calm lull came back. Pure presence, pure relaxation. ""Salud"" said Taita. I leaned back and drank the yage, and said Gracias to Taita.

&amp;#x200B;

The only descriptions of the drink will be Earthy ones.  It looks like it's water from the Amazon River, with a consistency like muddy water. It tastes like you're drinking a gritty granulated mud drink. Like you took muddy water and put a flavorless protein bar mixed in it for texture. 

&amp;#x200B;

I walked back to my sleeping mat and sat like all others at the end of my mat facing the middle. ""Try and hold it in for at least a half hour"" he told all of us. I remember thinking to myself that that shouldn't be too hard. 

&amp;#x200B;

About five minutes after I sat down, one of the first people in line to take the yage started vomiting. ""oh shit.. that was fast. Nowhere near a half hour"" I thought to myself. I centered my focus, listening to the song Taita sung and repeating my expectations and hopes for my journey in my head. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ten minutes later my body was overwhelmed with this warmth. I considered taking off my jacket, I was starting to get sweaty. As I was about to, I burped. I tasted the yage and started to feel sick. ""Push through it. Go back to your focus."" And I did. But then I burped again. This time the smallest bit of the acidic brew ended up in the back of my throat. As fast as it came up, I grabbed a bottle of water and sipped it back down. Or so I thought. A minute later, I was staring deep into my bucket, vomiting out a thick brown paste resembling refried beans. 

&amp;#x200B;

After a few minutes of purging I felt much better. They say the purge is essential, that it's very therapeutic. That you release all of your negative energy. They also say it is difficult, that you are processing the emotions that you are purging as you are purging them. That didn't happen for me, I plain and simply just puked. I laid down on my back after my purge, staring at the candle flicking off the ceiling, waiting for the visions to kick in. 

&amp;#x200B;

Time seemed to slow to a still. I felt frozen in that moment forever. Which was fine by me, I felt content and comfortable and I had an idea of how the night would progress. An hour or so passed and I still had no visions. I could tell some around me were, And others were laying down seemingly asleep. Confused and disoriented, not knowing what to think or feel in this situation (only expecting visions) I laid down somewhat angrily, feeling like I'd been cheated. Why could others enjoy the level of experience I was seeking? Why was I stuck at this stand still? Why couldn't I let go and go deeper? I announced my intentions at the beginning. I told myself I was ready to let go from the first minute. What was holding me back? Was the brew not strong enough? Did I get a weak cup? Is this all a fraud? How is this fair? My angst just kept seeming to grow. My impatience just grew and grew. This is not what I was expecting. I'm really disappointed.

&amp;#x200B;

As I'm thinking these things, still watching the candlelight flick on the ceiling of the tent, a faint whistle from outside the tent started coming closer and closer. My mind cued into the sound, like a dog to a dog whistle. Something is calling me. ""Second cup!"" announced Taita. ""If la medicina is not working on you, come up for a second cup."" Since I wasn't getting the visions I wanted, the medicine surely wasn't working on me. I need a second cup. I stood up and got in line for my second cup. The fear was gone, the anxiousness was gone. I was nothing but calm the entire wait in line. As I approached Taita, he asked if I felt la medicina. I told him no, and his translator told me he was going to give me something to make it stronger. I drank my second cup, and Taita ground a powder and prepared it on the end of a instrument to blow it all the way up my nose. He blew one gust into each nostril. The powder didn't burn like most other powders may, it was comparatively very pleasant. 

&amp;#x200B;

I went and sat back down, resetting my expectations. ""Second cup. Double the dose. Some unknown powder to make it stronger. I'm SET. Here come the visions. Let's go.""

&amp;#x200B;

I sat up for a half hour, waiting for the brew to finish digesting. This entire time I expected the purge again, but it never came. I felt mild discomfort for awhile but it slowly went away. I laid down and covered myself in blankets to get warm and focused this time on closing my eyes to see if I could see any visions. There was still nothing. I laid there frustrated still, wondering why this was happening to me? Why was I being robbed of the experience of others? Was it because Taita said if we came for a psychedelic experience we wouldn't get one? When he stared me in the eyes is that what he saw? Could he tell? Is he punishing me? This doesn't feel fair. I came all this way and I can't even get the one thing I wanted the most? I wanted to see my past problems. I wanted to relive them, I wanted to be cleansed of them. I started to feel sick again, my stomach turning over and over. 

&amp;#x200B;

These thoughts just raced for what seemed like eternity, my mind trapped in this selfish ego of wanting what I wanted. Ignoring what I needed. Not trusting the medicine. Not placing my faith in Taita or Pachamama. Suddenly something brought me out of my mind, it was a harmonica playing very softly in the distance. It crept closer and closer, louder and louder, playing an entrancing melody that just wiped the slate clean. There was nothing to think, there was only to feel. It was Taita on the harmonica, coming back into the tent to summon our attention. ""Third cup! No chicken!""

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted a third cup because I knew it was the ticket to visions. I wanted that access. But my body wasn't allowing it. My stomach wasn't allowing it. So I laid there and just tried to coach myself through my discomfort. After all, I was in control, right?

&amp;#x200B;

Wrong. I laid down and faced Taita as he sat in his chair blessing everyone who came up for a third cup. I watched the candlelight and felt the warmth from it merging with his voice. I felt it all channeling into me and embracing me with its warmth. My side started hurting, so I turned to face the other way, which was directly facing darkness. My mind said ""Are you ready to embrace the darkness?"" Of course I was. I had been asking for it since I got there. About 5 minutes after everyone who wanted a third cup got their cup, Ian started playing a song. The song started out so soft and serene, and just built and built. It got stronger and stronger and I felt it moving the medicine inside me. I felt the song wrenching throughout my body, twisting and turning different aspects in tune with the music it heard and felt. The song built to a crescendo and I sat up as fast as I could and grabbed my bucket and purged. This purge was stronger than my first one, but still much easier than my worst fears coming into ceremony. 

&amp;#x200B;

After the purge all I wanted was to lay down and relax. So that's what I did. I replayed over and over in my head Taita's opening ceremony. If you come seeking a psychedelic experience, you won't get it. The medicine gives you what you need, not what you want. 

&amp;#x200B;

I guess I'll describe what happened next as wrestling in and out of consciousness the rest of the night, only summoned back when Taita made his re-entrance, or another song or chant played. 

&amp;#x200B;

After a refreshing nights sleep, I woke up and walked over to the fire in the sunrise. There sat a few people still deep in their visions from last night, and some who had awoken as I had. Most shared their experiences while I sat trying to make sense of mine. I heard so many things that made me jealous and I sat there listening, bitter, trying to remember if I had any epiphanies or realizations that could alter or change my life for the positive. After all, that's what I came here for, isn't it?

&amp;#x200B;

As I sat there staring at the fire searching my brain for a deeper meaning within me, I fumbled over any avenue. I watched as the fire danced and twirled, changing energy from solid wood to smoke right before my eyes. I've watched fire on many instances in my life, and it never occured to me as a transfer of energy. The heat licking my face as I stared, was this my first perspective shift as a result of experiencing last night? If so, I was unsatisfied. After all, big deal. 

&amp;#x200B;

I wouldn't realize the symbolism of this moment until 24 hours later.

&amp;#x200B;

The In Between

&amp;#x200B;

While a bunch of us were hanging out by the fire, Pedro came out and sat with us. He asked how everyone was doing, how their experience was. It was a time for sharing, although I didn't feel I had much to share. When he asked how I was, I said ""good"" and he looked at me like he knew I was lying. A little after this he told us the story of the first time he drank the brew. He was in Columbia with his grandfather, also a shaman. His grandfather gave him the drink, and told him to drink it and lay down in the grass. Pedro said he laid down in the grass, and didn't move the entire time. He said he became the grass, the soil, the trees, the air, the sky, the wind, and everything that comprised his environment. He told the story much beautifully than I did, and I was left to keep wondering what I missed last night. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure if I mentioned it, but everyone knew it was an outdoor ceremony except for me and my friend who invited me. This lead to us being underprepared for 45 degree weather the first night, but the neighborly atmosphere and giving nature of everyone there for the ceremony helped us stifle that rather promptly. We had a tarp given to us, a bunch of blankets, and even some extra layers. Everyone was incredibly welcoming, the feeling of familia was evident from the moment we arrived, but kept growing with every minute we spent together.

&amp;#x200B;

The forecast for tonight called for near zero temperatures, freezing rain and snow, and major gusts of wind. Because of this, my friend and I had to venture to Wal-Mart a half hour away to buy things that no one had extras to give us. Gloves, thermals, new socks and shoes (both of ours got ruined the first day), hand warmers, and other random items. 

&amp;#x200B;

We went to Wal-Mart and decided to get lunch afterwards. We ate about 6 hours before ceremony. You're not supposed to eat or eat anything heavy, because there is a certainty that you're going to end up throwing it up. But I was feeling somewhat spiteful and vengeful, and wasn't concerned with the purge so I ate a very large and pleasant meal while we discussed our experience from the first evening. 

&amp;#x200B;

This whole time I kept searching for a difference between the day before and I couldn't find it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Night 2

&amp;#x200B;

When we got back to the campsite, we arrived to find that our entire sleeping quarters was destroyed from a leak in the tent. It was pouring the whole time we were gone. Our blankets were soaked, pillows, sleeping pads, tarp, our bags. And it was just our stuff. Everyone else in the tent appeared unscathed. Without a change of clothes, or pillows, or dry blankets, you'd figure I'd be furious. But somehow we both found a way to just laugh it out, execute a plan to move past it, and perform those actions. I'm very much the type to get upset when things don't go to plan, when curveballs pop up. Especially after driving over a half hour to buy stuff to better prepare us for an Arctic evening, we come back to find the stuff we DID have destroyed basically. 

&amp;#x200B;

Once we got our sleeping quarters resolved it was about 7pm. At this point the wind was coming in strong, the freezing rain continued, the fire roared outside the tent. But sitting outside by the fire meant soaking yourself, so we decided to huddle up in the tent with many others. The host gave me even more blankets (I ended up borrowing 4 total from her) and I made the joke that the blankets, which were very native american in design, were infected with small pox. The joke went over well, yay I made a funny!

&amp;#x200B;

We laid in the tent until ceremony because at this point it became about conserving energy and braving the elements and preparing for battle. I ended up falling asleep around 9 and slept until 11. Around midnight Pedro came back in with the brew.

&amp;#x200B;

He started out as he did the first night by blessing the drink. And then he gave a speech as he did the first night. He told us that last night was a night of many struggles and reflection. That the medicine showed us what we needed to do to become better. That people have lost touch with their spirit. The medicine is the spirit. Tonight will be a beautiful evening he told us. All I could do was hope.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to drinking the cup. 12:24 AM. There was no nervousness at all. After all, I knew how it tasted. I knew I was going to throw up. I decided to do my best to clear my conscience and expectations. So after I drank it I went and sat down indian style with my palms up in the receiving stance. I sat and silenced my mind, and did my best to meditate. My first priority was to prevent myself from purging in the first half hour so the medicine could take its full effect. I didn't want to control the experience, so I tried not to think of anything. I tried to just exist. And I did. I never once got the urge to purge, I just felt perfect stillness and calm. After about 20 minutes I decided to lay down and close my eyes. 

&amp;#x200B;

I checked my phone after one hour, and I was shocked an hour had gone by. At this point if I purged, it wouldn't make a difference. I sat up, still expecting visions, and when I didn't have any, I just mentally gave up on that aspect of the experience. I remember thinking something along the lines of ""stop expecting and just exist""

&amp;#x200B;

I asked my friend if he wanted to go out to the fire. The rain had stopped, the ground was covered in mud. The winds were blasting, but I never left the tent the first night. It only made sense that I would see benefits if I got up and got my blood flowing and walked around. When we got to the fire, I sat down and stared at the faces around me staring at the fire. I wondered what they were thinking, if they were seeing anything. After a few minutes I couldn't stay comfortable from the cold and the smoke blowing in my eyes, so I went and laid back down in the tent. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I laid down, I remembered my friend telling me that he likes to cover himself entirely with his blanket. That it feels better to him than just closing his eyes. He called it the cocoon. I figured hey, why not, I'll try it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I laid on my side and wrapped myself in the cocoon. As soon as I did, a mild feeling of nausea overcame me. Inside the pitch black cocoon, I could still see my own breath. I guess this qualifies as visuals. I wrestled with this feeling of nausea, contemplating throwing up, or sitting back up. It was about this moment that I started to think about things in my life that generally upset me. I started to replay moments in my life that stick out as shaping my personality, and I started to defend myself in those moments. 

&amp;#x200B;

Suddenly, these ""I"" thoughts were quickly countered with a ""you"" response. This just kept happening and happening, and I found myself arguing with myself, so to speak. The nausea and my brain kept tossing and turning, flipping and flopping. 

&amp;#x200B;

Around this time, Pedro came in and offered ""second cup! it's free!"" I was about to sit up when I heard ""You don't need any more medicine."" ""Of course I do, it isn't working."" ""Yes it is"" ""No it's not"". This went on for a minute or two. I could hear Pedro outside the cocoon blessing other peoples cups, and kept thinking I should get up so I could have more. ""I want to see things"" ""You don't need to see things"" ""Then why did I come here?"" ""You came here to find out the truth."" 

&amp;#x200B;

When I heard that, I remembered what Pedro said on the first night. We all came here seeking the cure. The medicine isn't the cure. The medicine will show you what the cure is. The cure is you. (I just started crying while typing this and reliving this moment)

&amp;#x200B;

It was at this one empowering moment of humility that I remember thinking, ""I don't need any more medicine"" ""You're right"" ""I am the cure."" ""Yes you are"" 

&amp;#x200B;

This moment where I surrendered my ego ended up being the moment I needed this entire experience. Or rather, my entire life to this point. I felt this feeling of absurd bliss at this moment, that I had just solved the puzzle.

&amp;#x200B;

But the medicine had other plans for the time being. With my ego finally surrendered, the medicine took hold and took control of me. The medicine showed me, time and again, all of my failures in life. It showed me my role in them, the result of them. It showed me it was all MY fault. It wasn't anyone elses fault but my own. I made the decisions, I made the wrong ones. As these memories and feelings came flooding back, I became overwhelmed with sadness. I cried, and cried and cried. I couldn't stop. My tears were storming down my cheeks. My nose was running all over. I couldn't move, I was stricken and paralyzed and exposed to the truth. Everything in my life I've ever passed blame to others on was laid before me and explained in a different light. I re-experienced all of these events in the third person, seeing my role and understanding it on an entirely different level. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure how long this continued, but if I had to guess I was crying for a good 45 minutes. I remember thinking to myself, ""wow, I came all the way here to realize that I was the problem and the solution all at once"" and the medicine, more or less, laughed at me for coming all the way up there and sleeping outside in freezing temperatures just to find that out. The answer was in me all along, but I ignored it like many others do. 

&amp;#x200B;

Shortly after I was done crying, I heard the whistle. Pedro was coming back. I popped my head out of the cocoon and felt energized. I felt ready to take on the world. Pedro said, ""Third cup.. no chicken!"" My instinct said go get one! But it was quickly silenced with the knowledge that I didn't need more. I had figured it out. The medicine had already shown me that I WAS in control over my past, and I AM in control over my present. 

&amp;#x200B;

At this moment I sat up with my friend and all sadness shifted to joy. And all negativity shifted back to empowerment. I felt in control of my life for the first time in a long time. I've often felt like I was a passenger in my own life. That all of these bad things just kept happening to me, that I played little or no part in it. It was all bad luck. 

&amp;#x200B;

My transformation still felt incomplete though, so I decided to go back into the cocoon. When I was inside, I wanted to shift my thoughts toward the future. After doing comprehensive work on my past, I needed to understand what the future had in store for me. This is when I realized I've spent my whole life silencing this aspect of my personality. I've spent too much time selfishly living in the moment. I realized I needed to become my peak self to stop this trajectory. I started to think of ways that I was self sabotaging myself. I was thinking of ways that I could become a better version of myself. 

&amp;#x200B;

And one thing stood out clear above many other things. I have been relying entirely too much on marijuana to simply exist. This is an aspect of my personality that I've known for a long time, but  I've never thought about it enough to act on it. It's always ended up as an excuse. An excuse to quell stress. An excuse to numb pain. An excuse to stifle boredom. An excuse to help sleep. An excuse for social interaction. I started to think about how long I've been using it as a crutch and how it played into all of these past scenarios that were presented before me earlier.

&amp;#x200B;

I started to realize I could never reach my peak self if I was using it as much as I did. I started to look at every day as a 45 degree upward trend on a chart. And the second I decided to smoke, it may make me ""higher"" at the moment, but eventually I'd crash down. My entire trajectory for the day would be altered. I'd never become what I needed to become, or what my potential had in store for me. After all, I have the medicine. I am the cure. 

&amp;#x200B;

This feeling of empowerment lead to me bursting out of the cocoon around 4am, completely empowered and feeling transformed. The epiphanies I had been searching for my entire life with entheogen use had finally come to me. Not only had them come to me, but they flowed through me like my blood, like the medicine. The energy I felt was that epiphany. That realization that I was in control, that I do have power. 

&amp;#x200B;

My friend and I were on a similar plane at this moment, so we shared in laughter and hugs. We kept trying to summon Pedro, who was over by the fire. Eventually after about a half hour, he came over and offered another cup to everyone. Not a single part of me wanted or needed another cup. Unlike the 2nd and 3rd where I was toying with the idea, for awhile, I wanted no part of that 4th cup. I felt whole for the first time I could remember in my life. All I was missing was the harmonica. So I asked, ""Taita, harmonica!""

&amp;#x200B;

And there it was. That beautiful harmonica. That melody that was dancing through my head the past two nights. That melody tickled its way all over my body unlike any other song I'd heard in my life. I went to pull my phone out to record the sound and couldn't figure out how to do it. I couldn't find the voice recorder. It never occured to me that I could just record video and it would pick up the sound. Lol. 

&amp;#x200B;

Shortly after this, I ended up falling asleep for an hour or two until the sun started coming up. As soon as it did I walked outside with many others to watch the sunrise by the fire. Snow was falling down on the ground. Winds were blowing wildly. Everything felt perfect. I had emerged from the cocoon transformed into a different figure, ruled by different ideas and ideals. 

&amp;#x200B;

Standing around the fire surrounded by complete strangers, I looked at their faces and knew they had endured with me. I loved everyone. We were all la familia. I started crying feeling shame for any moments that I gave a stranger a dirty look. Or cursed out a car in front of me. Or just any moment in my life where I wasn't as open and offering as we all were that weekend. EVERYBODY IS LA FAMILIA. 

&amp;#x200B;

The Blessing

&amp;#x200B;

We all gathered in the tent at 9am for the closing blessing of the ceremony. Perdo gave an incredibly beautiful closing speech that I couldn't even try to put to words. He knew we had all seen the light. He told us that we need to share the knowledge of the medicine with everyone, so that we can help save the world one by one. The collective conscience that is currently ruling the planet is ruining it, and we must do what we can to help save it. He told us that last night was a night of transformation, that we will all become better versions of ourselves as a result of this weekend.

&amp;#x200B;

He told us he was going to go around the tent and cleanse us. He played the harmonica and danced around shaking his rattle walking around in front of each of us. As he got closer and closer to me, the energy became so overpowering I just started crying so hard. 

&amp;#x200B;

After that, he told us to take our hoods off. He told us think of everything we no longer want in our lives. Think about it with our eyes closed, and he was going to go around and remove it from us. I just kept thinking ""No fear, no anger, no pain"" He walked around the tent with a rock or crystal, placing it on the top of everyones heads and sucking 2 or 3 times and then spitting. He got to my friend next to me and did this. Before he came to me, suddenly he ran out of the tent and started puking. Immediately I thought and it felt like he was purging those negative emotions that he was absorbing. He was transferring our negative energy into himself, and acting as a vessel for us to cleanse us. He came back to me and cleansed me. And then walked around the rest of the room and cleansed everyone else. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then he told us to think of the things we do want in our lives. ""comfort, cause, content, direction"" I repeated in my head over and over. He walked around and blessed us one by one as we kneeled there with our eyes closed. Shortly after this, he walked around and thanked all of us for coming and sprayed our hands with some liquid which we then rubbed all over our faces. 

&amp;#x200B;

During the entire closing of the ceremony, I was crying or directly on the cusp of it. Part of it was sadness that the experience was ending. Part of it was out of a feeling of pure elation. Part of it was just knowing how transformed I felt in a period of two nights, despite my experience being much MUCH less intense than anyone elses. I can only think how powerful everyone elses experiences was, and how changed they felt. 

&amp;#x200B;

Aftermath

&amp;#x200B;

It has become clear in the two days after the blessing that the feeling of calmness hasn't left me. I'm much more patient throughout the course of my day. I don't remotely feel the urge to smoke marijuana. I feel a renewed sense of passion and purpose. I have a greater empathy for anyone I see or think of. I feel content despite all of my adversarial aspects in my life right now. I've tried welcoming back my old negative mindset that used to be so prominent, and it doesn't even have a voice anymore. I listen to songs that consistently made me cry and don't cry anymore. I feel energized and empassioned. I feel elated.

&amp;#x200B;

I've long said that I am trying to become the best version of myself every day, that I'm constantly seeking to improve. But now I've been shown what hinders that. Both in my actions and aspects of my personality. I've been shown what grooms that, and I'm working to continue in that direction.

&amp;#x200B;

They say that drinking ayahuasca is work. I knew this going in. Having finally done it, I can't argue that. It was work to listen to what was told to me. It was work to process the deeper meaning behind all of it. It is work to implement it and continue down that path.

&amp;#x200B;

Did ayahuasca change me? No. Did it show me what I needed to do to change? Yes. Did ayahuasca work? That depends what you mean. It shone a light on things that were dark. It brought clarity to things that were blurred. But I'm the one doing the work.

My name is Marc McLean and I’m an author based in Scotland. This time last year I was called to ayahuasca at what was probably the lowest point in my life. By the time my second ceremony was over my subconscious was blown apart…I saw what had really been going on my whole life…and I experienced incredible healing.

I now want to write a book about ayahuasca – focusing specifically on how it’s transforming more and more people across Europe. 

I want to include a series of positive case studies, sharing the incredible journeys of men and women who have taken the medicine. Their lives before, during, and after ayahuasca.

Is there anyone on this group who would be interested in being interviewed by me and being featured in the book? This would simply be done via Skype/phone calls.

*** Also, I'll share what I've written about your story with you prior to publication....so that you're happy with everything ***

If so, please send me an email with your name and a brief description of your ayahuasca story to: themedicine2018@gmail.com

I found out during my research however, that the aya purge is really good for clearing your gut of parasites. I’ve got an ongoing stomach problem I picked up about 5 years ago, that doctors haven’t really been able to figure out, but I reckon I can trace it to a specific time getting ill from canal water, and feel there’s some sort of parasite etc. still in there causing trouble. 

On account of this I’m pretty tempted to go ahead and book an ayahuasca retreat whilst I have the chance (currently travelling in South America) in order to purge and sort this problem out. I’d be going into it with the mindset of mainly healing my stomach, and getting a mad interesting experience throw in on top. Anyone done a retreat for similar reasons/got any advice?

1796,"Hello fellow psychonauts, Im here today seeking advice, tips, direction and general help. Lets get right down to it:

I  have done many types of drugs in my life (im only 26). I have gone to  the absolute edge of mushroom trips and they have definitely changed me  deeply. I cant even count the amount of trips where I've taken  approximately 7-8 grams at once, which I would personally consider a  pretty huge dose. All that to say that I am no stranger to the depths  that can be reached with psychedelics.

I  have never done LSD and honestly the horror stories I have heard about  being stuck in Acidland have basically solidified my decision (at least  for now) to never try that in my life.

Now,  2018 has probably been one of the roughest years of my life thus far.  Lost job, lost partner, lost my license due to intoxication, totaled my  first and only car, gained a criminal record and generally have no idea  who I am or what I should be doing anymore. My closest friends have all  moved across the country and my immediate family is basically a mess  (that part has been true for most of my life).

The  good thing to come from all of this is that for the past 2 years while I  was working, I have saved nearly every penny and find myself more  financially healthy then I have ever been in my life. My girlfriend and I  had been saving up to get married and move into our own home within  months from now but that has all changed due to circumstances out of my  control and I'm left here without a responsibility in the world, all the  time on my hands that anyone can ask for and nothing but questions that  I feel the burning desire to seek answers to.

This  is where my interest in Ayahuasca began. I have been reading trip  reports, searching for good retreats and doing what I can to understand  the journey I am about to embark on. I have struggled with binge  drinking, depression, cigarettes, and lacking the ability to see joy in  the world for quite some time now. I need to reconnect with the earth  itself and the people that we all are. Mushrooms have helped me do that  before but I feel like I need something that is really going to kick my  ass so to speak, something that might be very difficult but worth it in  the end.

So my questions to you fellow trippers are these:

Do  you think Ayahuasca is the right choice for someone like me as  described? Or would you suggest something else or maybe lighter to begin  with (peyote, san pedro etc...)

Which  retreats/areas would be the most recommended? I ask this because there  are so many listings for this stuff that it has become mind boggling to  decide on where to go.

I am planning on  doing this trip alone; as in I am traveling to and from wherever I may  go on a solo trip, but not necessarily doing the ceremony itself  completely alone (from what i can see its done in small groups usually).  Is that a bad idea? Would it be best to have a companion to experience  it with? (this would also mean waiting until a friend could get the time  off and money together etc...)

That is  all I can really think of for now, if anything needs clarification or  elaboration I have no problem with that. Any and all advice, input will  be carefully considered and I will reply with what I can.

I had the blessing of having my first experience with mother aya about 4 years ago.  It was planned, my good friend is a member of the Santo Daime church in Austin.  I went through the process of becoming a member and went down to partake of a works.

After I took my first portion, we started singing hymns.  After about 4 hymns (15 min or so) I started getting the closed eye visions.  They looked like I was in a neon rollercoaster.  Very intense and awesome.  I was sitting at a table and candle light was all the light there was.  As I opened my eyes, I saw myself slowly rise up above my body.   I thought that I had died, but I was at amazing peace with it.  I looked around and then returned to my body.  

I purged SEVERAL times.   After the fourth time, when I knew I had nothing left, I started to cry out of fear.   I heard a very soothing, loving voice in my head tell me that it was all alright.  It wasn't stuff from my stomach I was purging...it was negative and blocked up emotions from my soul.  She helped through that.

I was sitting there meditating and I left the Earth was was among the stars. Constellations starting coming to me, being connected.  The planets shone in the sky, even the further one as if they were right there.  I heard the same voice again tell me that this is what my gift it, my way of bettering myself and the world.  I had always been interested in astrology, even since I was a kid.  But, I realized I need to do that more.  I needed to be that mirror to people that astrology can be.  To show them the beauty and gifts they have on the inside that they cannot see themselves.   To show them that their quirks are a part of them and how to work with them...that they are beautiful and like the way they are for a reason. 

The entire time I felt embraced by love.  My main takeaway was that no matter what, I am never alone.  I always have someone looking out for me and there to help.  I started really delving into astrological studies after that.  I give readings now...when I have time.  I def feel rewarded for the positive feedback  I get and to know that the people I read for, their lives are touched.

I am planning to go again in February.  I hear her calling for me again.   I feel her inside me, helping me, nudging me in the right direction.  ",Ayahuasca,My first experience

""The ADF is aware of at least four occurrences so far this year. This wave of new incidents and arrests has alarmed practitioners and communities alike.

Two incidents stem from traveling with ayahuasca. One occurred at the airport when a person was flying into Florida. The defendant was apprehended when traveling to Miami from Colombia with four liters of ayahuasca; after six months of Court hearings and wearing a monitoring bracelet, he was offered the option to plead guilty with the possibility of the felony being reduced to a minor offence. Almost one year later, this case is still ongoing and the defendant – who initially denied he was carrying ayahuasca – subsequently declared that he used it as a medicine and for ceremonial purposes.

The second incident occurred while someone was crossing the US-Canada border by car. The CBP found, based on New York state law, that crossing the border carrying ayahuasca constituted a felony. It is important to mention that when the incident occurred, the authorities did not have any knowledge about ayahuasca, and therefore categorized it as a “Class X” substance, i.e. DMT. The defendant was detained and remained out of communication for three days, after which they were charged with “criminal possession of a controlled substance” (DMT). Although the felony was later reduced to a misdemeanor, the Canadian defendant had to pay a $1,200 fine and was banned from entering the United States.

Two additional incidents were reported, both regarding the receipt of ayahuasca shipments mailed from Peru. In one case, the CBP considered it the “unlawful importation of a controlled substance and smuggling goods into the US.” However, the property was seized by the CBP before anyone received it. Because the package was then abandoned with no “claim of interest,” the incident concluded with the forfeiture of proceedings.

In the other incident, a person received a package containing ayahuasca, which was then used as grounds by law enforcement to raid and search the person´s home.  The material was seized and allegedly submitted for analysis by a Forensic Laboratory, after which a formal indictment was delivered by a grand jury in the State of Illinois. The individual has been charged with “possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver.” The defendant is being charged with possession of DMT (a “Class X” substance) and has been under house arrest and not able to work since that time.""

We are a Brazilian duo  involved with the Huni Kui native indigenous group from Brazil and we would like to  talk to you [about a project and ask for your support that is missing 8 days for its completion. ](https://gogetfunding.com/hunikuin)

We are asking everyone that already has any good experience with  ayahuasca, this sacred plant which traveled from South America to the  whole world spreading many blessings,, to contribute to this cause, this  film which has many interviews with shamans and leaders sharing their  knowledge with the world.

Here is our story.

6 months ago we were in the  jungles of Amazon in Brazil, in Acre, staying for 2 months with the *Huni Kuin* people,  as they say, the true people, the keepers of the sacred medicine. They  a very special tribe from the Amazonian region who fought and still  fights to keep their ancient knowledge and their traditional way of  life. There we produced a film that unveils their unique culture, way of living and work with  spirituality, which was a small project for a short film and became naturally a massive project for a feature film, as the leaders decided to speak.

https://i.redd.it/i00hi70xdve11.jpg

We interviewed many shamans and leaders sharing about their existence, telling their story of struggle with oppression from invasions and even from our government in Brazil... but mainly sharing their way of  living, seeing and acting in the world trough the medicine, with a message of peace and  union.

The Huni Kuin  culture is based on their spiritual work with the medicines from the  forest, this connection is what they define as culture, seeking for  balance with nature and themselves, spreading cure and love from their  village and beyond. **The project is a way to share their divine knowledge  from the jungles of Brazil to many film festivals, schools,  universities, to give them a way of sharing that they are alive, they  want union and they are here to help healing the world.**

If  you could support us, spread trough your network and support us, we and the Huni  Kui people will be truly thankful. 

We all really need this support in order to help them to keep their culture alive and make themselves  visible, because here in Brazil there is now an extermination of  indigenous culture.  
There is plenty of  unusual and precious rewards for your support, which mainly all come  from the Huni Kuin tribe, or you can even get a ticket to this year's  festival!

First time ayahuasca user here. I have a ceremony on the 14th and was thinking of doing a 1-2 week water fast before. With water fasts, to my understanding, it is crucial to keep your electrolytes up in the form of salt, nosalt (potassium substitute) and magnesium supplements.

1810,"So I've been posting on here about my trip to Peru coming up on Mar 31st. I've been reading a lot of experiances and seen a lot about depression, ptsd, and addictive behaviors and how a lot of that has been helped through the ceremony's. 

I'm curious if anyone who has had issues with cheating on their spouse has any experience with Aya and if it helped in anyway. When I started looking into going on a retreat I was mainly looking to help me work through some depression and past personal issues but as I read more and more about peoples experience I'm wondering if it can help me with this issue. 

I actually don't have a spouse anymore because of this compulsive addiction to chatting and ultimately sleeping with other women when I was married. THe divorce has been very difficult for me and left me reflecting alot on my behavious and I thought I would swear it off for good. 

However fast forward 3 years after divorce and I'm with another very incredible woman that I want to make happy and treat right but I feel myself constantly having to fight off these urges to talk to other woman. I've had this issue for over 10 years now, I've realized that all I'm after is constant validation from other woman to make me feel wanted.

1821,"So I'm pretty new to psychedelic media in general but via the ATTMind podcast I discovered James Kent and his DoseNation podcast's final 10 episodes. Much of it sounds like a mea culpa from someone who's become extremely disillusioned with the entire psychedelic movement (of which he was fully part of) but the episode he did on ayahuasca is definitely worth a listen:

http://www.dosenation.com/listing.php?smlid=8856

Some of the major points by James Kent:

* He underscores the beneficial effect that changing one's diet / purging one's GI tract will have on one's sense of well being. (i.e. - The beneficial after-effects are not all from the trip itself)
* Argues that the ayahuasca purge should be viewed as a poisoning since that is why your body reacts to it by vomiting / diarrhea.
* Describes how he experimented in making his own DIY ayahuasca and after playing with it to minimize the GI effects, he argues that the truly psychedelic part of the trip only lasts about 1 hour.
* Calls bullshit on all of the spiritual aspects of the ceremony.
* Finishes up with the typical horror stories of ceremonies leading to death and unscrupulous shamans.
* In the ATTMind podcast he commented that he saw no good reason to do ayahuasca multiple days in a row and suggested that the main reason it happens is to increase the ""bang for one's buck"" when one treks all the way to a retreat in Peru.

To be honest, he calls bullshit on pretty much everything. He seems to really enjoy saying the word, ""Bullshit,"" pronouncing the word with an extended drawl. 7 podcasts in, he has shown a tendency to cherry pick or put up straw men that he knocks down with gusto and to be frank, the tone has become a bit wearying.

But the above link is worth a listen. Even though he can be one-sided, ignoring any discussion of people who seem to have had resoundingly positive experiences with ayahuasca, he makes some thoughtful arguments about the overall practice. 

(For the record, I've not done ayahuasca, I've just been seeking information on it and that's how I came across these podcasts. I would love to hear people's thoughts on it.)",Ayahuasca,DoseNation Podcast (6 of 10 - The Master) on Ayahuasca

It seems that Kava is a MAO-B inhibitor ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9832350](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9832350)).

1828,"I'm interested in using memantine to prevent tolerance to, and toxicity from, frequent but not daily use of stimulants, specifically dexamphetamine. Memantine has been shown to prevent tolerance to opioids (eg r/[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0091305795021639](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0091305795021639)) and prevent neurotoxicity from amphetamines (eg r/[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002839080800097X](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002839080800097X)). There are a variety of case reports on various message boards describing how people have used memantine, sometimes in combination with a stack of substances such as magnesium or l-tyrosine to prevent tolerance from amphetamines.

This would not be problematic, except I also use galantamine a few times a week to facilitate lucid dreaming, which it is very helpful for ([https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201246](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201246)). Both memantine and galantamine are used, occasionally in combination, to treat Alzheimers disease. Memantine is an NMDA antagonist, and galantamine is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. Donepezil, also an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor is another Alzheimer's medication, which has been shown to be neurotoxic in combination with memantine ! (r/[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2246087/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2246087/) !). Memantine and galantamine are not specifically contraindicated in clinical practise due to negative interaction, but the neurotoxicity of donepezil , which is in the same class as galantamine, and memantine concerns me.

I thought I would take a closer look at the doses used in the donepezil/memantine study. After all, 100 L of water would have probably have lethal consequences as a daily dose, even though water is not generally considered toxic.

&amp;#x200B;

*Maximum normal daily doses in clinical practice:*

&amp;#x200B;

Memantine 20mg

Galantamine 24mg

Donepezil 10mg

&amp;#x200B;

*Maximum normal daily mg/kg for 85kg in clinical practise (divide normal daily dose by 85kg):*

&amp;#x200B;

Memantine 0.235mg/kg

Galantamine 0.282mg/kg

Donepezil 0.12mg/kg

&amp;#x200B;

Neurotoxic effects were observed in the study in doses as low as memantine 10mg/kg in combination with donepezil 5mg/kg. These are obviously much higher than the above doses, but since rats and humans have different surface area/weight ratio's, a rat dose must be divided by 6.2 to approximate a human dose (r/[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4804402/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4804402/)).

&amp;#x200B;

*These converted lowest toxic doses are:*

&amp;#x200B;

Memantine (10mg/kg /6.2) = 1.6 mg/kg

Donepezil (10mg/kg /5) = 0.8 mg/kg

A factor of 2.35 related the maximum normal daily dose of galantamine/donepezil (0.282/0.12), so the equivalent converted lowest toxic dose of 

Galantamine (0.8mg/kg  x 2.35) = 1.9 mg/kg.

&amp;#x200B;

However the situation is further complicated by the fact that memantine has a long half life of 60-70 hours. This means that steady state concentration after several days dosing is much higher than after a single dose. Steady state concentration is 3-4 times that of a single dose ( r/[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18498913](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18498913) , r/[http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en\_GB/document\_library/EPAR\_-\_Scientific\_Discussion/human/000463/WC500058759.pdf](http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/EPAR_-_Scientific_Discussion/human/000463/WC500058759.pdf)). As such, the converted lowest toxic daily dose for memantine needs to be divided by 3.5 to give an appropriate daily dose - thus memantine lowest toxic daily dose accounting for steady state concentration is (1.6/3.5) 0.457mg/kg.

&amp;#x200B;

*Thus the lowest daily doses for an 85kg person which are not neurotoxic in combination are:*

&amp;#x200B;

Galantamine (1.9 mg/kg x 85kg)x 85) = 161 mg

Memantine (0.457 mg/kg x 85) = 39mg

&amp;#x200B;

Both of these are below the maximum recommended clinical doses for galantamine (28mg/day) and memantine (20mg/day). However, 39mg for memantine is not that much more than 20mg. Furthermore, occasionally I take alkalising agents to reduce elimination and thus extend the half life of amphetamines. Memantine clearance can be reduced up to 80% in alkaline urine (r/[https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda\_docs/label/2005/021627lbl.pdf](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2005/021627lbl.pdf) ). As such, rather than taking the maximum daily dose of 20mg memantine, I think I'll be trialling 10mg, which even if concentrations are increased by alkaline urine should still be well below potentially neurotoxic levels. In the evenings before taking galantamine two or three times a week, I will acidify my urine (probably with Vit C), to aid elimination of the memantine, and I will not take galantamine on the same days that I alkalise my urine. 

I'd be interested to have others go through and check my working. Also would be interested in others use of memantine in combination with amphetamine - what doses and other substances have you found helpful ?

1829,"As someone who currently cannot utilize cannabinoids for their neuroptotectant properties such as prevention of excitotoxicity and antioxidation, I have delved deep into the world of substances to find something that I can take regularly to combat the toxicity associated with amphetamines.

I take amphetamines at therapeutic dosages and have read a myriad of studies saying there is/is not damage from such usage, especially overtime.

I found 7-8dihydroxyflavone and bought some. It’s expensive but literature states that it has a myriad of brain boosting properties ranging from prevention of methamphetamine induced neurotoxicity to an increase of synaptogenesis. 

The following study is highly interesting. 
“Furthermore, pretreatment and subsequent administration of 7,8-DHF (10 mg/kg) attenuated the reduction of dopamine transporter (DAT) in the striatum after repeated administration of METH (3.0 mg/kg × 3 at 3-hourly intervals). ” That is extremely important. Reduction of DAT is noted all throughout amphetamine usage studies. 

“Moreover, 7,8-DHF attenuated microglial activation in the striatum after repeated administration of METH.”
That’s even more important in my eyes. Reduction of glial activation??? As we all know glial scars prevent the creation of new synapses and act as permanent brain scars really.

Wanted to hear your studies on this, or just 7-8dihydroxyflavone in general.
I honestly can't say whether or not the 78DHF is helping me or not, but I think that's due to the fact that it has only been a week. Also the research stresses the point that the ""fixes"" that 78DHF has are most noticeable when the damage is worst.

1831,"I haven't had the time lately to do much research on this topic so I'm crowd sourcing information here.

I've been thinking about terpenes lately and began to wonder: has anyone experimented with taking terpenes before smoking/vaping/eating weed? Terpenes seem to modulate the activity of THC and CBD and are responsible for the differences between different strains. The details of this modulation are not well understood.

We're all familiar with eating mangos before smoking weed in order to enhance/intensify/extend the high. Mangoes contain myrcene, a terpene that is found in high levels in indica strains but not sativa strains. Thus it is believed that myrcene is at least partially responsible for the body high/couch lock that indicas generally provide. I'm not sure how much myrcene the average mango contains, but it must be quite a lot to change the high as much as mangos can do.

So, mangos are cool, but what about other terpenes? I've read that Jack Herer contains high levels of pinene, another terpene. You can buy pinene and other terpenes [online for cheap](https://www.buyterpenesonline.com/terpenes-for-sale/alpha-pinene/?attribute_pa_size=4-oz&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAt4rfBRBKEiwAC678KdZyJUMrDvmFM_oTaaJEio8SDlNLLWpiTeTzAEH1ZGTd-LRUg-k11xoC5q0QAvD_BwE) (this is just the first link I found, no idea if it's legitimate).

As it is reported by many users, visuals in shroom trip after ayahuasca became similar to that of ayahuasca. But I did not expect the other effects: the usual euphoria did not come this time.

1841,"I have been on the medicine path for a year now, doing multiple ceremonies and currently on a three month microdosing regiment underneath a shaman in Peru. It has changed my life in many beautiful ways. 

One thing I’ve noticed is that my ideas of sex and masturbation have completely changed. I am a woman and have been very “free” my adult life sexually. A lot of meaningless sex and no worries about it. After doing ayahuasca, it showed me that it truly is a “sacred energy exchange” and that meaningless sex is a misguided use of something extremely powerful. (I know not everyone will share that opinion and that’s fine, just my personal feelings towards it for myself). I understand why they say to abstain from sex near taking ayahuasca. It is the transference of an energy much stronger than most people realize. 

Now with masturbation, that’s changed a lot for me too. I used to masturbate a lot. Now whenever I do, I feel like I’m releasing something powerful and that it’s yet another misguided use of that energy. I almost feel guilty. I’ve only masturbated a couple times this year. I have a partner that I have a great sex life with and a part of me feels I should reserve that energy for the moments with each other. I haven’t talked to him about this so it’s not him influencing me in anyway. I’m unsure about how I feel about it altogether. I like masturbating but it’s so different for me now. Has anyone experienced these feelings about masturbation? 

And out of curiosity, did ayahuasca change your views of sex? What are your views on it? 

Sorry if this is inappropriate in any way.  Thanks to anyone who read. May your journeys be beautiful :)

1843,"Hello, fellow Reddit users. I pose a question to you all. I have been thinking about a possible way to make a salvia nasal spray. However, there isn't much in terms of its solubility in various liquids that would be safe for intranasal use. I was thinking of a 10% DMSO solution to reach my desired 1mg/ml potency. But I have seen very mixed views on DMSO being used by humans. As far as I  know, 5% DMSO has been tested as safe, but the solubility of salvinorin a is said to be greater than or equal to 10mg/ml in DMSO. Assuming the worst, and it was 10mg/ml, that 5% mixture wouldn't work for what I would like to do. So I was wondering if any of you know of any (safe for intranasal use) liquids that salvinorin a is soluble in. Preferably I would like to have the solubility to be anywhere from 5mg/ml to 20mg/ml at around 25c so that when the temp goes down, it doesn't become less soluble and crash out. So to add some backstory to this so you guys can try to figure it out if you wish, my plan is to put it into a nasal spray bottle that doses .1ml per spray. This comes out to 100 micrograms per spray. I think that should be a decent dose per spray since a starter dose is roundabout 200 micrograms. I was going to either buy pure extract and make it in bulk or let the leaves sit in the liquid to absorb it. I think the safest method would be to buy pure salvinorin a and make it my the 100ml or so. Anyways let me know what you guys know. I'll still be researching.

&amp;#x200B;

Update: Found out that salvinorin a is a hydrophobic diterpene. Other common hydrophobic diterpenes are phyto-cannabinoids. This may be as simple as extracting it with acetone or ethanol and adding that to some glycerine, PG or VG and letting the original solvent evaporate. Someone also mentioned salvia tabs. First I gotta say that's an amazing idea. In theory, you would only have to extract it with an evaporating solvent, spray or soak your sheet, and let it evaporate. This isn't something I've ever thought about but it is definitely a possibility that I will have to try out in the near future. Hopefully, next update will be ordering some pure salvinorin a to test with.

&amp;#x200B;

Update 2: Since this is the same class as cannabinoids, I could, theoretically, make this into a **tincture** or nasal spray using MCT coconut oil, into a **vape juice** with PG&amp;VG, or into **edibles** with butter or something similar. I got into this thinking this would take a while to get solved and/or not work. But this can potentially open up a new world of safe, controlled doses of Salvia Divinorum. Time to start a business?

&amp;#x200B;

Update 3: I have ordered everything necessary to start the extraction of pure salvinorin a. The salvia will be the longest to show up so I'm just waiting on that. Found a pretty good deal on 120g of salvia (normal potency) dried and crushed leaves for $65. This should theoretically give me 300mg if I make a 100% efficient extraction. I'll be happy if I even get 100 out of it. Realistically I'll probably get close to 250 if I want to make it as pure as possible.

&amp;#x200B;

Update 3: I have tested the CBD nasal spray and it works flawlessly. It absorbed into the MCT oil quickly and without hassle. This is giving me high hopes for the salvinorin a. I also found a lab procedure outlining how to make the inclusion complex needed to make it bioavailable in the mouth and nostrils. This is a huge step forward in the process. Since I found such a good deal on salvia leaves, I will be able to do many trials and find out what works best.",DrugNerds,Salvinorin A Nasal Spray

1851,"Basically I was isolated throughout my teens and 20s and am still isolated now in my early 30s. I was very social in childhood and then a combination of negative things happening alienated me from other people and I have been cast out ever since, and engaging in all kinds of self sabotage and self hate and depression. I'm not just upset at the lost time, but also how I've let my physical health and appearance dramatically decline and let myself start really aging. So much that I feel I can experience in life is shut off now because of this. I have so many white hairs, I'm basically starting to die before I even got a chance to live.  

I was thinking maybe doing aya could help me, but now I'm thinking it might be a bad idea for me. 10-15 years ago, it would have been what I needed, because all that was blocking me was in my head at that time. If aya shows you the truth, I would have realized it was very good when I was younger. Now I'm not so sure doing aya would be a good idea. 

I'm very afraid that it will just take me to hell by showing all the great things I've missed out on in life and still won't get to experience. The thing is I know that no matter what I do from now on, life is going to be severely disappointing.  I can see/feel easily in my head the life I expected to live and should have led had I not had mental illness. All the experiences I should have and expected to have, that all my peers growing up had and my sisters had, and that I see young people living all around me in this city. The joy with friends and being young, out and enjoying life. I feel that what I've missed out on is just going to haunt me for the rest of my life. Even if I figure out a way to start my life now... it's not going to live up to even a small fraction of what I expected to experience. And most of the youthful things I still want to do are much harder to do from now on, partially because older people are less accepted doing those things, and also for many other reasons.

Do you think I should partake in this aya ceremony? Could it help me? Or do you think it could just torture me and make me even more depressed about my life? Right now, I can't seem to change anything, still stuck in this purgatory with more time being lost.

​

Perhaps I am just super sensitive, but here goes my experience which I wrote down the day after the experience:

Yesterday I arrived a little early in front of the Shaman’s house. He seated us all on cushions, each set up with a blanket and colorful purging buckets. Cute. His place was humble but very clean and filled with a nice, light, comfortable atmosphere. The 6 people including myself would be lined up against the wall and encouraged to sit up right throughout the entire journey. All of us came very introspective into this and were mentally preparing for what was yet to come, however only two of us, myself and an acquaintance of mine - who unexpectedly walked through the door - were newbies taking the medicine. Everybody was facing a piano and wall of hand-carved musical instruments, except the Shaman who was facing us. Surrounded by intricate hand-carved wooden sculptures, a wall of books, and some gem stones, rocks and crystals, we were anticipating the visionary insights we would be able to tap into, based on the info I had gathered so far from friends and personal accounts on the internet. My stomach was growling and I was looking forward to filling my belly with anything - even with a nasty brew - after only eating clean: raw or steamed vegetables, nut milk, fresh green juices, brown rice, fruits, potatoes and broth.

The Shaman then proceeded with laying out the rules of the ceremony:

No talking. If one needs help he or she should preferably ask for it in between the Icaros (or songs he would be singing to guide the experience), and to be mindful about our puke buckets to avoid unnecessary turbulence.

He continued reminding us about the nature of the journey once more and pointed out that if someone should have the strong urge to lessen the experience - which he wouldn’t recommend, as the tough part is usually the part that ignites healing - he could offer lemon which would help break down the medicine. As an alternative he also had Melantonin ready, which would help you fall asleep. Again not recommended but at least some sort of “out”. I didn’t consider any of this since I was certain I would be able to handle whatever was about to happen. I was confidently relying on my only true reference points: my experiences with LSD and mushrooms. I could have never been more wrong!

The Shaman started the ceremony with lowering the lights and prepping \*Rape snuff to be blown into the participants nostrils. I politely declined, having read about the intense burning and discomfort this causes in your nasal ways - especially after I had just healed them doing the Kambo. Perhaps that was my mistake. And maybe this would have helped me. Who knows, this is history now. I continued to meditate and tried to center myself as much as possible, but felt pretty calm. The Shaman started fanning what I believe was a special tobacco smoke onto our heads and into the room and blew smoke onto the crown of our heads, one by one. I can’t remember if this was before or after he gave each of us a full cup of the brew. I was the second one after the Shaman to intake the liquid, which tasted surprisingly good with a strong licorice taste, on the sweeter site. It was nice and smooth and went down easily. I thought wow, I am doing good! Now let the show begin! The Shaman said: “now for the next 30minutes to an hour just meditate. Don’t ask yourself if you’re feeling the medicine, because trust me, you will know once it kicked in. I will be serving a second cup in an hour.”

Maybe 20 minutes passed where we sat in darkness and total silence when the hardwood floor at my feet started to slightly protrude and recede. I felt a bit nervous with this feeling of anticipation. I expected what I had a reference point to. I was waiting for the hallucinations to appear in front of me like images or shapes projected on the dark wall where the piano was standing or in front of my closed eyes. The Shaman started singing, calling Ayahuasca and all the sudden shapes started appearing and surrounding me and I felt this really queasy feeling of euphoria like when you take ecstasy and I felt producing a large grin. Almost giggling I was thinking, “Oh this is going to be good”... But then instead of a gradual increase in a change of perception I all the sudden found myself outside my physical body. It felt like my consciousness floated right in front of my head, being attached by string at the position where your third eye is supposed to be. Holy cow, what is THIS? What the hell did I sign up for? I am dying!! The usual components of life on earth were pulled away under my feet: No concept of space and time! The now faint voice of my ego was screaming in terror from somewhere else: “I need help!” Pause. “ I need to get out of here!” Pause. “ I need this to stop! This is way too intense!” Pause.  I then realized my body collapsed in itself, I felt my physical head hanging down like the one of a marionette and I started drifting away into blackness, that’s when survival instinct kicked in and I mustered to hiss: ”I need help. I am about to lose consciousness. I am dying.” I realized the Shaman was singing and deep down somewhere I knew that I would be disturbing the ceremony. I made out the Shaman’s presence and energy below this other layer of constantly morphing, swirling shapes but when I looked at him, it wasn’t the guy I was sitting in the room with just half an hour ago. He looked large and stoic (even though he is of smaller and skinnier statue not under the influence) resembling an otherworldly creature reminiscent of Mayan or Aztec culture, and not entirely human. When he stood in profile I noticed black and white feathery wings and his head reminded me of something like an Eagle’s head placed on top of his real head which wasn’t visible. Yet I wasn’t afraid. I trusted him. When I called him and heard his familiar voice, it gave me only a smidge of what felt like comfort until I realized there is no EXIT button of this situation and I had to ride it out. I literally panicked internally. He said:”Do you want me to give you lemon?” I mustered all my focus uttering:”Will this make it stop?” He replied:”No, but it will lessen the intensity.” I said:”I need it to stop.” He said:”You came to me because you said you were ready. And you are ready. Now you just need to do the work. Let me play two more songs. This will pass, ok?” I tried to make sense of his words but couldn’t figure out what he meant by “work”? Is this imprisonment in hell I found myself in considered to be the work? Will I get the insights I was seeking after this passes? The Shaman continued the Icaros which continued my suffering and personal purgatory as the swirling spirals engulfed me, inducing vertigo. I figured I have to let myself throw up the medicine - and this realization originated from pure survival instinct. I gagged dry a few times with no results. My ego was in panic mode. I felt slipping away and all the sudden all I could think about is that if I stopped breathing I would die and never return. So whatever horrendous scenario this was I had to focus on taking deep breaths. I must have exaggerated the breaths so that I could feel the vibrations from my body reaching my consciousness and to remind myself that I am still alive and well. And I can’t put into words how much I was struggling to keep this body alive and breathing. At least that's what it felt like to me. Losing focus just briefly would have drawn me in deeper into the experience and I couldn’t let this happen because in my Ego that meant death. I continued to try to gag, when I felt the Shaman moving towards me like he accelerated through flight. “You don’t have to throw up you know. This will pass. Do you want me to give you some lemon now?” I said:”yes, lemons please.” A moment or eternity later he appeared with the lemons and I was hoping to come back from nomansland but I hardly felt a difference. I kept thinking how much longer? How much time has passed? I could’t make it through much longer. The swirling shapes and overall too much information kept getting me dizzy and again THERE IS NO ESCAPE from it. You can’t look away from a scene, because you’re not seeing with your eyes or even with your ego, you are seeing as consciousness, you literally are the scene. I kept feeling like throwing up so the bucket was my biggest friend throughout. I kept holding it for comfort but over and over I had to touch its shape to ensure it was the bucket and not another object I was about to hopefully projectile vomit into VERY SOON to get this “medicine” out of me. The bucket felt more narrow and very long. When I started leaning back against the wall that I knew for a fact was there when I first sat down, the wall just kept giving - moving back into space accommodating me somehow. I found myself laying completely flat on my back, but it couldn’t have happened as the seats we were assigned to were very confined in space. I definitely experienced some shape shifting when I needed more space, the realm would just adjust. The lemons didn’t bring much relief and when the Shaman announced the second cup it occurred to me that only 1 hour had past. ONE!!! Meaning several more to go...although I must have already lived through eons. I started to become very unsettled clinging on to the idea a purge would help me lessen the impact. I continued to try to gag into the bucket when the white creature, which I somehow knew was the Shaman (in a different form?)  was in front of me - or whatever was still left of me - asking if I wanted to go into the other room with him. He told me:”If you want to make yourself gag you have to keep your fingers in your throat until you purge.” I couldn’t fully grasp what he was saying, so I awkwardly tried to find my hands to stuff into my mouth which felt like an endless tunnel made out of shifting molecules. When my hand reached down my throat I could see and feel the insides of my throat on a molecular level. There was no rigidity of mass, just loose molecules interspersed by some colored dots. I had trouble figuring out where to find my gag reflex. I can’t remember if I did puke or not, but I didn’t feel better. Now the Shaman was on my other side. He looked like a white naked creature with no genitals. A bit like a white friendly pitbull with a face that had two large black spaces where eyes should be. Almost Alien-like. The fascinating aspect about the visuals were that they were constant and not changing in shape like they would on LSD or mushrooms. They were crystal clear throughout the session. The Shaman’s established appearance never varied or morphed aside from the 2 forms he took. He told me to sit by the window to catch some fresh air. The experience wouldn’t be as strong there. He was right. After a while I started feeling better figuring I would be able to handle this now, being more adjusted to my new state of no escape purgatory. When I somehow managed to navigate back into the room that still seemed familiar featuring its original core qualities, everything was dark and “peaceful”. My physical surrounding looked recognizable, albeit skewed. It was as if I had plastic glasses on in which octagonal shapes were etched into in different thicknesses. I thought “ah this is getting better now”, little did I know that the Icaros would correlate directly to the effects of the plant. When the Shaman proceeded with his songs it was like a gradient mask animating from the center out, revealing the entire world again in almost even stronger “glory”. I had a really hard time with the dizziness but continued to continuously move back and forth on my cushion to scratch the surface of making this bearable at the least. New shapes popped back in with me being one of them? Randomly and superimposed on the shape level, cryptic codes would appear fading in from one direction, appearing like superimposed holograms so sharp and intricate only a computer could generate.

When one does Ayahuasca for the first time there is simply no experience that could prepare you entering a completely different state of being. There was no forewarning. No gradual shapes appearing. It’s like someone pushed a button and thought it would be a great idea to turn me into a nano atom splitting my consciousness, soul, being or whatever you want to call it away from my Ego and body in which I unfortunately or fortunately was still trapped in. The intensity of this new state was absolutely terrifying and unbearable to say the least. Struggling with understanding where “I” was and how all my parts are connected with each other was frightening. It occurred to me that this is pure purgatory. A myriad of intertwined black, twirling, most intricate shapes and geometrical designs outlined and pulsed through by the most vivid colors of the rainbow, constantly moving, existing in this realm of white eternity in which “I”- or my consciousness just was. Other than on LSD or mushrooms,  you felt split from our reality somehow. It didn’t matter if you closed or opened your eyes. The world was ever present and ever surrounding, which made it so difficult to cope with. You can't just close your eyes and get a break. You are constantly blasted with imagery.  I could best describe it by comparing it to wearing a VR headset running psychedelic geometry in 3D space; or like someone sticking your head into a lightbox of the most intricate designs, that were three-dimensional and alive, while having your eyelids stapled to your brows when time and space are completely eliminated and your mind starts to exist seemingly separately from your human form- and even that is a huge understatement.

I had no concept of time and with my eyes closed there was just the ether. It seemed like I peaked right from the get go and lasted in that state for almost the entire 3 hours. I can say that I now understand the pictorial of the third eye. All I felt being was an eye. An observer. Awareness. I felt void of emotions. I couldn't say I felt particularly loved or rejected but maybe because I was so preoccupied to not lose touch with my physical body while a universe of twirling shapes and codes appeared around me. Everything was just hyper vivid and exploding with color. I noticed that when the Shaman finished a song everything retreated into blackness with a few sprinkles of glowing colorful light dots remaining as I was taking in a deep breath and exhaled with utter relief. Feeling better. When he picked back up calling the plant the show started up again in even stronger intensity. And then, after what seemed a lifetime,  everything faded away as quickly as it came on. I was wondering what was in store for me now? The teachings? Personal interaction with mother ayahuasca? But the room was still and dark and I could make out The Shaman in his human form who just finished a song. I used the opportunity to tell him that my visions had stopped and if I should brace myself for more? Completely overwhelmed I was ecstatic to hear that the session was about to close. Never have I been so grateful to be back into my familiar surrounding - the world I was used to. The body I knew. The physical space. The only thing I have ever known. Now I know why noone would do this ever purely for recreational use. It's simply gut wrenching.

The day after the ceremony I felt detached still. Not quite settled in my body. Something was off. My mind was still in overdrive trying to make sense of what I had just experienced. Revisiting the visions and feelings my split being had. It's been two days and not one minute has passed when I haven't thought about the experience and tried analyzing every aspect of it.

1870,"Hello folks!

I wrapped my mind around ayahuasca today and i've came up with a pretty special way to consume it.
(Got only Freebase DMT at hand)

The base of this approach is the following post on DMT Nexus: "" https://wiki.dmt-nexus.me/Ayahuasca_using_Syrian_Rue_%26_Acacia_confusa ""

# FirstQuestion: So is it possible to make the Syrian Rue-brew (4g boiled 3 times to 80ml), drink it, wait XX(30?) minutes (for MAO to work) and then just ""eat"" 115mg Freebase DMT or drink a water/115mg Freebase DMT solution, to get a full ayahuasca effect? Does this even work?

I choosed 115mg dosage, because the Acacia confusa 10g contains about 1,15% DMT, which is about 115mg DMT.

# SecondQuestion: Which whould be a 
Threshold-Dosage
Light-Dosage
Medium-Dosage
Strong-Dosage
Overkill-Dosage?

I assume its not equal to Freebase DMT, because 115mg whould be a hell of a ride of vaporised DMT

Hi everybody !



I'm French and it is my first time posting in r/DrugNerds so excuse me if there are some mistakes or if I use the wrong language.



I also know this subject has already been discussed many times but I had some questions about certain aspects of this topic which I think haven't been raised before. It will be a bit long and technical, however I truly believe we can all benefit from the points of view some of you could offer concerning these interrogations.



I'm sure a lot of you guys remember the amazing post made by "" MisterYouAreSoDumb "" several years ago in which he gave many tips to reduce MDMA induced neurotoxicity (which can be found here https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/DrugNerds/comments/15m9sf/mdma_supplementation/#ampf=undefined).



In this post he mentions food we can consume before, during, and after the trip to achieve such a goal and also to minimize the comedown : a focus is made on the grapefruit juice, able to inhibit the CYP3A4 enzyme, responsible for the partial conversion of MDMA in its neurotoxic metabolites.



1) Here, a first question comes to my mind : since MDMA is also able to inhibit the CYPD26 enzyme mainly in charge of its metabolisation in the liver (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16714321), wouldn't drinking grapefruit juice before a roll overload these CYPD26 enzymes because of MDMA (the CYP3A4 being already inactivated), to eventually trade neurotoxicity against hepatotoxicity ? I guess the liver is still more resistant than the brain but I had to ask.
Then, the fact that "" only the CYPD26 is able to function "" after the grapefruit consumption (although almost all of is activity is canceled within an hour because of MDMA according to the previous research article), is it really safe to ingest all the compounds MisterYouAreSoDumb suggests ? Won't the liver be overloaded once again ? Won't there be some potentially dangerous over-expressions of certain of them because of these inhibitions ?



2) Furthermore, I understand the reasons why it is interesting to take
all of them, but does anybody have some solid scientific sources concerning the dosages of every substance which are mentioned ? Indeed, last time I tried these (not including the CoQ10 nor the Acetyl - L - Carnitine though), I felt my stomach a bit overloaded with all that, but the roll was perfect and the comedown pretty decent. It was mostly due to a safe dosage I think, but it certainly did help a bit. Hence, I also would've appreciated to have your point of view concerning the rolls you made after having followed such a method of supplementation, and I would like this post to eventually become a place where we can list new ways of supplementation you may think of. Do you believe the fact of supplementing only the day of the roll to be really relevant also ? I personally will begin it several days before next time I think (except for the 5-HTP of course).



3) What about the kidneys also ? Since MDMA leads to the release of the vasopressin hormone which leads to difficulties of water excretion, so the kidneys have to work more than usual, do you think it is wise to flood them with so much additionnal compounds once again ? (Assuming a wise water consumption of about 300 mL/hour for instance).



4) Assuming again a "" reasonable dosage "", to what extent is the amount of magnesium glycinate proposed by MisterYouAreSoDumb capable of reducing excitotoxicity compared to another NMDA - blocker such as memantine, which has been proven to prevent MDMA neurotoxicity, through its antagonistic action on alpha 7 - nACh receptors notably ? (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/17980434/).
Do you think 20mg of memantine before a roll is advisable, as assumed in this other post of a Reddit user testing it on himself ? 
https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/DrugNerds/comments/4rw8p5/self_testing_selegiline_to_prevent_mdma_induced/



5) Last question. A source of neurotoxicity induced by MDMA would be the oxydation of dopamine by monoamine oxydase - B once mistakenly reuptaken into the serotonergic pre-synaptic neuron as detailed in the previously mentioned post.
Its author uses a monoamine oxydase (of the B type) inhibitor (MAOI - B) to avoid this undesirable effect, called "" selegiline "", which has also been proven to greatly reduce MDMA neurotoxicity  (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11813232). Once again, do you think the dosage he evokes is safe, since once a certain threshold is reached, a MAOI-B can turn into a MAOI-A thus leading to a serotonergic syndrome ?
Couldn't the excess of dopamine hence obtained by the inhibition of its degradation lead to a greater and potentially more dangerous stimulation of the cardiovascular system (higher blood pressure, etc.), while one more time trading neurotoxicity against cardiotoxicity ? Do you know any MAOI-B (even coming from natural sources) which can be efficient and not turn into a MAOI-A once a certain dosage is reached ?




I think I'm done. Thank you if you did read the whole post , I'm waiting for your comments :)



EDIT : I know there is ketamine in the above picture, but it was in a post I linked, and it seems I can't do nothing about that image being there. Of course it is not the subject of the topic.

",DrugNerds,MDMA induced neurotoxicity : additional questions on harm reduction
1881,"The Human Death Exp.

20mg Dmt freebase with 120-180mg harmine hcl. I generally wake up around five a.m. naturally and dose the harmala alkaloids one hour after waking. Only drinking water the first few hours after waking up. Thirty minutes after dosing the harmala alkaloids I ingest the twenty milligrams of DMT freebase.

This is my diet, it works well with me and is very selective and restrictive.  

Generally consume two grams of cannabis a day.

No alcohol is in my diet except from kambucha once a week.

Diet for one week prior, during and current. Water, ample amounts of water. I’ve always been one to preach and practice about the lack of water humans consume. I generally consume at the very least one gallon a day with trace minerals. RO (reverse osmosis) water of course.

Surplus amount of cashews, almonds, walnuts and macadamia nuts. RxBar and Kind bar in the morning with orange and banana. Polyphenol mix drink. Three eggs for lunch. In the evening I will generally eat oatmeal, brown rice with noodles. Never any dairy products, no need.  No bread as well.

No other drugs or substances. I tried my best on collecting everything that I ingested. I don’t eat much and its for nutrition for comfort. Lots of water.

Two full droppers of Potassium Iodine every morning.

I go through periods of malnutrition and fasting along with intermediate fasting. Eating has been reduced down to nutrients over nourishment.

Since starting the micro dosing my days are boasting full of energy. Sleep is right on Que as well. Which is the best part? The dreaded TOOTHACHE!

I’d had a toothache prior to daily experimentation of DMT and harmala alkaloids. Now this one tooth was a stubborn life long curse so I truly believed. Every winter the toothache returned. Head splintering pain. Had to get one removed five months prior on the right side of my mouth. Ends up the sensitivity I’ve experienced my whole life was due to being in the one percent of people that have three roots on a molar instead the usual one or two.

Well, during the first week, I had an experience of a total of 400mg of harmala alkaloids and 120 mg DMT freebase. It was something else for another time, the main healing that I obtained from that experience was a resonating frequency that rattled the entire left side of my head down to the core of my tooth. I took a deep breath in and exhaled deep. Love, smiles, peace, content, ease and appreciation of self was overwhelming. The power that the harmala alkaloids hold are incredible. Still no tooth pain of any kind whatsoever.

Currently on the third day of completely eradicating nicotine from my life. Nicotine has been with me in some for or another for half my life. Literally. Since the trip and microdosing my shift of conscience and layered thought pattern have let me be analytical of my emotions that arise during a nicotine surge, I simply acknowledge it and pass on. Truly overcame nicotine addiction I feel. That will be a test of time.

Mentally, my philosophy has not changed but rather been tweaked. After a life of constant spiritual exploration which would look to be homelessness and poverty but an endeavor on the human mind and what constitutes reality. Epiphanies seem to be common, self realizations of inner space and outer space. Any sliver of depressive or reckless behavior is completely absent. Total control and moderation with all intake and output. The amount of “real” control feel is immense. Many thoughts keep coming to mind of a theory that ancient human took in more mao a inhibitors that also led to the natural synthesis of dmt to be more prominent. Thus letting the natural flow of dmt be present potentiated and prominent in a multitude of cultures.

Typing this is the second week of microdosing with oral DMT and harmala alkaloids. There has been a shift in my perception, imagine if you can, all the sudden your vision looks as if progressive scanning has been activated on a monitor screen. It is constant. The build up of psychoactive effects are prominent, colors are brighter with a vivid detailed in depth hue with layers of intrinsically shading system. The reason the air seems “full” whenever you look around on dmt with your eyes open. That becomes more accessible with more frequent use. So hear me out. The abundance of dmt lets one be in the moment with reality. The many levels of reality. So many levels that it all comes down to one. Time has almost truly dissolved. I’ve eradicated procrastination from my attributes. This chemical substance is truly the essence of nature and reality. Once you are inside of that world. Take out the aspect of spiritual and realize physical, metaphysical and spiritual are all the same. Its beautiful and I’m satisfied with my findings and results.  

Over all I have always been a happy person, not outgoing to other people. Put me into a stand off with an entity and I will never back down from their intimidation factor. I always marvel in their awe and treat them as an equal. Just as I do humans.

On the fourth night I went to sleep around 9:45 pm and woke up at 1:30 am. Smoked cannabis, drank two full glasses of water. Smoked 40mg Dmt freebase and an entity rushed me and forced his being on my self image. I never backed down or felt frightful in my own rite. My psyche knew that if something happened like that in the tangible world, then I should fear for my life. Which led me to having a breakdown of thoughts and analyzing concepts and ideas which eliminated the need to rely on irrational fears that are usually prominent and known for lurking in general psychosis patients. Visualizing is key to changing mindset. The mindset is key to visualizing change.

I put myself through this and extended years of trials and tribulation with a multitude of compounds, substances and metaphysical magic. Nothing compares to the mystical mindset of deep understanding that comes with the harmala alkaloids. As far as tolerance goes, there has been no tolerating the substance. Which inclines me to believe that dmt doesn’t necessarily act like a compounding substance. I’ve had instances where I would take minimal MAO inhibition with heroic doses of dmt. I can attain the same experiences while doing the diet mentioned above with daily use of harmala alkaloids and around 40-100mg dose range. So dmt acts differently by it doesn’t compound but rather the amount will result in the frequency you resonate with compiled and articulated from surrounding energy fields.

Persistent radiating internal vibrations are always apparent. As well with tracers and always prevalent in depth analysis of my surroundings. I feel as if I’ve hit my primal pinnacle of exploration and fascinating ideas of mystical answers. I’m happy with life now. The never ending ouroboros reality we live in will never satisfy the needy. Its not tangible.              

Honestly I could go on for days. In the end DMT in conjunction with harmala alkaloids have healed me physically and mentally. I went into this journey fifteen years ago and being persistent with well over three hundred encounters with different psychoactive plants. I’m not claiming to have tried them all. But would say that I’m up there with other pyschonauts that dedicate their mind and body to the underground world of metaphysical science.

I do plan on going back on my notes and making a more detailed report of micro dosing oral dmt and harmala alkaloids.

1882,"I have a chance to participate in a ceremony this summer and wanted to read up on it before deciding. I see comments about meditating everywhere. I meditate maybe 4 times a year. What is important about meditation and why does meditation seem to be a part of it all?

I also see quite a few posts of people who suffer mentally or has had really terrible things happen to them in the past and they seek out the medicine. While I do have my baggage I never needed to medicate and I found out about ayahuasca because I was curious. I like to think most stuff happens for a reason so maybe I'm not as well as I thought? 

In the documentaries I've seen people are laying really close to each other. I don't want to vomit and scream in terror next to some random and ruin their trip, is there an option to be alone during a trip? Or are you so out of it you don't realize anything happening on earth?

1883,"Tl;DR:  Have Social Anxiety, Ayahuasca didnt help; Got extremely frustrated and aggressive during my trip; Does anybody have experience with this or some tips?

I\`ll try to keep this short.

I am 21 and suffer from some very serious social anxiety. I basically always feel extremely uncomfortable in social situations and I feel like I am not good enough.  Over the years Ive tried a lot, but no matter how much discipline I have in my job or in the gym I always feel inferiour and I isolate myself from other people because I always have this terrible feeling like I need to hide who I am. I have no real friends or a girlfriend.

If you met me, I probably couldnt look you in the eyes for longer than a few seconds and I would constantly try to be the person you\`d like, instead of being just myself. I cant show any genuine emotion, instead I am kind of ""fake nice"" and I try to be liked by everyone. I hate myself for doing that, but even though I say ""fake nice"" that doesnt mean that I dont genuinely like or respect other people. Its just that I cant be my real self.

So then I tried Ayahuasca (2 times by myself and then on a one day retreat with other people).

I went in with the intention (obviously) to fix my social anxiety and feel okay with myself.

Im not going to go into details, because I dont think they matter that much. During my first 2 trips, the beginning often felt nice, for several minutes I felt extreme love for myself and for just about anything. It was probably one of the best feelings I\`ve ever had in my life. But soon I started to ruminate and to ask ""what do I have to do to be normal after this trip is over? How can I fix my social anxiety in ""real life""?

I asked again and again what the answer to my problems is. I kept envisioning ""just go, just be yourself""  and I would feel very frustratred, because after each trip my social anxiety just came back immediately.

I then went on a one day retreat. I thought that maybe I had done something wrong with my ayahuasca cooking and that  a real retreat would help me get lasting benefits from ayahuasca.

It didnt go to well. I drank the first serving and I basically immediately started ruminating and intensely thinking about how I can be normal. I was actually thinking so ""hard"" that I got some real headaches during the trip.

We were then served a second serving and man I had a really intense Aya trip but then I also became very aggressive and frustrated against myself and also against everyone else. I dont remember everything, but I do remember talking like a demon (for example I said ""I will kill you all"" and stuff like that) and punching my sleeping matress like a psychopath . The trip eventually ended, and I started to feel extremely ashamed of myself for behaving like that and I was also kind of angry at Ayahuasca for not helping me. (I realize that Its not the fault of this plant)

Almost a year has passed since this last trip, but I still occasionally think about this ashamed.

My question basically is this: Could it be, that Ayahausca just cant help with social anxiety and should I just stop taking it?

Or maybe do I need to have a different approach or take a lower/higher dosage? Maybe a five day retreat would help, by cleansing me of my anger first and then ""rebuilding"" me on the next few days?

Honestly any tips/experiences/help would be greatly appreciated by me.

Edit: I want to thank all of you for giving me advice!

Edit 2: So I\`ve been thinking about your advice and Ive been reading on the internet. I believe I am overthinking things all of the time and my ego is just too big. Therefore I will give mindfulness meditation another shot. My new ""concept"" looks like this:

1. Self Discipline. I will continue to put in the work and to do what is right. So that means studying, working exercising and dieting properly.

2. Mindfulness Meditation. I will meditate for 20 minutes every day. Focus on my breath and whenever I notice my thoughts drifting away, I will redirect them to my breath.

3. NoFap. I guess I dont have to explain this one :)

I will try this out for a longer time now. I am hopeful and when I have made progress, I might just try Ayahuasca or Iboga or mushrooms down the line. Maybe in 6 Months or so. If I make progress, I will also create another thread to help other people with social anxiety. ",Ayahuasca,Had a very frustrating and depressing trip on Ayahuasca. Any help?

I suffer from major depression and anxiety in the past 3 years. I have constant stress, regrets and fear. My inner judgment is non stop with everything I come across and do. I suffer almost every second of my life.

Last night I attended an aya ceremony in the place I live. The shamans are young but I trust them after having a meeting with them prior to the ceremony (they made me cry and see hope).

We were 5 people in total and I came to it pretty open and excited (as much as I can). Completely letting go and be devoted is not an option for me because I genuinely hate myself for what I am at the moment. I was hoping tgat the medicine will show me its way through my fears and anger directed mostly to myself.

The trip was horrible. I kept on judging every second, feeling like I haven't felt anything at all. I didn't see grandma in any form. At the first 3 hours I still had hopes to get in touch with this higher frequency, but as time passed and I was having my intrusive loops of negative thinking (like I'm used to in my routine), I lost hope. I wanted it to end because all I felt is more of the same, only with no where to hide.

I really came to it as prepared as I could but couldn't feel anything but more anxious and depressed.

I feel like I have been preparing for this ceremony sufficiently. For the past month I've stopped smoking weed, followed the diet strictly, and began meditating more regularly. For the past two weeks I've stopped all sexual activity. I'm hoping all this will help me get the most out of this experience, but I'm still nervous about a few things.

First of all, I'm nervous that I might have some type of allergic reaction to the brew, and die. I don't have any allergies that I know of, so I know this isn't likely, and is probably just me getting in my head too much. I would say this is the least of my worries.

My biggest concern, however, is that I'll come back home after all of this and find out that nothing has changed. That would be extremely disappointing for a few reasons. For one, it would mean that I wasted all this time, money, and preparation for nothing. It would also be a little embarrassing. Everyone who I've told about this trip is already treating me condescendingly because of it, and saying it's stupid that I'm going to Peru just to ""do drugs"". I don't think they fully understand my reasons for doing this. I just can't imagine how poorly they'd treat me if I came back and they saw that I was still struggling.

1917,"After doing a lot of research, I'm very interested in Aya Madre (www.ayamadre.com) for my first retreat. I've read great things about Maestra Estela on this sub, at least in the context of Dreamglade (before she left to start this, her own center).

I wasn't sure how long I should go, so I looked into that too. Other posts on here say that two weeks would be good for a first-timer, as a lot of people take several ceremonies to really start digging deep, but those posts seemed to just be talking about Aya. But at Aya Madre, one week has three ceremonies: two Aya (Mon/Wed) and one San Pedro (Fri).

So what I'm wondering is if you think that an Aya/San Pedro combo like that would be ideal for a first-timer, or if it would perhaps be better to go to Dreamglade instead, where all three ceremonies each week are Aya. San Pedro does interest me, but my thought is that I might get more out of focusing on one type of brew the whole time, at least for my first time. On the other hand, I'm sure Maestra Estela offers both in a week for a reason! I just don't know enough about it yet to be able to decide, so I'm hoping to get some thoughts/insight. And I do think I'm going to do two weeks either way, unless anyone has any strong opinions otherwise.",Ayahuasca,Length of retreat &amp; types of ceremonies

1922,"As someone who currently cannot utilize cannabinoids for their neuroptotectant properties such as prevention of excitotoxicity and antioxidation, I have delved deep into the world of substances to find something that I can take regularly to combat the toxicity associated with amphetamines.

I take amphetamines at therapeutic dosages and have read a myriad of studies saying there is/is not damage from such usage, especially overtime.

I found 7-8dihydroxyflavone and bought some. It’s expensive but literature states that it has a myriad of brain boosting properties ranging from prevention of methamphetamine induced neurotoxicity to an increase of synaptogenesis. 

The following study is highly interesting. 
“Furthermore, pretreatment and subsequent administration of 7,8-DHF (10 mg/kg) attenuated the reduction of dopamine transporter (DAT) in the striatum after repeated administration of METH (3.0 mg/kg × 3 at 3-hourly intervals). ” That is extremely important. Reduction of DAT is noted all throughout amphetamine usage studies. 

“Moreover, 7,8-DHF attenuated microglial activation in the striatum after repeated administration of METH.”
That’s even more important in my eyes. Reduction of glial activation??? As we all know glial scars prevent the creation of new synapses and act as permanent brain scars really. 
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/23934209/

Wanted to hear your studies on this, or just 7-8dihydroxyflavone in general.
I honestly can't say whether or not the 78DHF is helping me or not, but I think that's due to the fact that it has only been a week. Also the research stresses the point that the ""fixes"" that 78DHF has are most noticeable when the damage is worst.

1930,"Hello all,

I've been having episodic depression and anxiety for most of the last 10 years. Through meditation and brief therapy work, I've come to realize much of this due to repressed emotions, being disconnected from my body and not having enough self-compassion. I'm keen to take ayahuasca to bring to light some of the difficult aspects of myself so I can meet them with love and integrate them. I understand this will be challenging but I am willing to put in the work.

One reservation, however, is I've also experienced mild derealisation, nothing too crazy, just visually everything can look a bit flat and or unreal. When this first happened to me I found it terrifying but I have more or less come to terms with it . The derealisation could well be connected with repressed emotions so i'm hoping ayahuasca might help me with it.  However, there is a still a concern ayahuasca could make it all worse and that an increase in derealisation could be too much to handle. Has anyone had any experiences taking Ayahuasca with similar symptoms, did it help?

Almost everything they say you need to eat is pretty much unavailable in most stores that don't cost a fortune (or at least it feels that way). And everything you can't eat is an ingredient in almost everything at every store near me. I don't know how I'm going to make this work.

Also every dieta source I read tends to recommend different foods, some stricter and some more lax. But even the lax ones seem difficult.

My main purpose is to try to avoid the bad headaches and diarrhea that they say happen when you don't follow the dieta. Can someone recommend things I can eat that I can get from an average grocery store that won't have significant physical reactions with ayahuasca? As lax as possible would be preferable but if not I'll take any advice.

1950,"Vice Article: https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/wd7v5n/why-pregnant-women-are-defying-their-doctors-advice-about-pot

I don’t usually read Vice articles, precisely because I find the level of bias frustrating. But this one in particular stood out as ludicrously irresponsible even for Vice. The take home of the article is that women with severe morning sickness are increasingly smoking cannabis to alleviate their symptoms due to concerns over Ondansetron’s safety during pregnancy. 

A cursory review of the literature yielded a 2011 BMJ review stating the evidence for Ondansetron causing birth defects was low quality (linked below) and recommended its use for treating hyperemesis gravidarum.
Additionally, I have read pretty extensively on peri-natal THC use and the results seem to suggest in a pretty compelling manner that THC is not good for the developing brain (review and animal model study linked).

I tend to be pretty indifferent to individual substance use regardless of its potential effects on one’s own body. But this level of misrepresentation of the facts seems actively malicious and on-par with an anti-vaxxer blog.
This is mostly just me seeking validation for my rant but I’m also curious how everyone else feels about this. It seems like people are inventing increasingly ridiculous applications for “medical marijuana” as public opinion shifts in its favor and I think it’s frustrating when people choose to blind themselves to the evidence that doesn’t support their idealistic view of Cannabis as a “miracle drug”.

1951,"Hi

I've been considering doing Ayahuasca for a very long time and I've researched it quite a lot. I think ti could really benefit me. However, I don't really know how to go about it. I went to ayaadvisors and its good and all but super expensive. And many of the sites have you sign terms and conditions greengage that you understand the process is not medicinal or therapeutic in nature, only for entertainment. I read those and was like wtf this is really sketchy.. For a 11 day retreat the whole trip would cost around $4500 (this includes the trip and flights). As well I know there are churches in Brazil like Santo Daime that hold monthly gatherings, however I'm not religious and they seam reeeeeallly into Jesus so...Also I'm not aligned with their views on sexual orientation so it may be really uncomfortable.

I'm seriously trying to find a way I can try this medicine, with an experienced and trustworthy Shaman in a safe place. I live in Australia but I'm not keen to try Aussiyusca for a first pass but I just don't know how or where to go. I've looked at the FAQ and and throughout this subreddit, through ayaadvisors and similar places but nowhere seems to offer a path that either seems legit and safe and/or is affortable.
